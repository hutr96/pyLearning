Airframe designs most likely to satisfy the first goal feature architectures that lead to the formation of non-uniform flow introduced to the engine through boundary layer ingesting (BLI) inlets, creating a different operational environment from which the engines were originally designed. The goal of this study was to explore the effects such non-uniform flow would have on the behavior and performance of a transonic fan in a full scale engine test environment. This dissertation presents an experimental study of the interaction between a full scale transonic fan and a total pressure distortion representative of a boundary layer ingesting serpentine inlet. A five-hole pneumatic probe was traversed directly in front of and behind a fan rotor to fully characterize the inlet and outlet fan profile. The distortion profile was also measured at the aerodynamic interface plane (AIP) with an SAE standard total pressure rake, which has historically been accepted as the inlet profile to the fan. This provided a comparison between the present work and current practice. Accurate calculation of local fan performance metrics such as blade loading, pressure rise, and efficiency were obtained. The fan inlet measurement profile greatly enhanced the understanding of the fan interaction to the flow distortion and provided a more complete explanation of the fan behavior. Secondary flowfield formation due to the accelerated flow redistribution directly upstream of the fan created localized bulk co- and counter- rotating swirl regions that were found to be correlated with localized fan performance phenomena. It was observed that the effects of the distortion on fan performance were exaggerated if the assumed fan inlet profiles were data taken only at the AIP. The reduction in fan performance with respect to undistorted inlet conditions is also explored, providing insight into how such distortions can be compared to baseline conditions. The dissertation closes with several recommendations for improving distortion tolerant fan design in the context of experimental research and development.\",","19":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","20":"\"description-provenance\": [","21":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-06T13:34:06Z (GMT).

First, truly unique dispositional constructs have not been identified since wide acceptance of the approach / avoidance distinction. Second, research has largely neglected to account for context in models of motivated behavior. Effective avoidance has systematically been unassessed in motivation research. Social cognitive theory was used to define an effective avoidance motivational trait, vigilance, as an antecedent to effective regulatory behaviors that are avoidant in nature and/or strategy. Two studies were conductedFirst, development and psychometric evaluation of a scale measuring vigilance within the existing motivational trait framework (Heggestad and Kanfer, 2000). Exploratory and confirmatory analyses provided initial validity evidence for the vigilance construct; composed of diligence and error-detection facets. Convergent \u2013 discriminant analysis revealed that vigilance is significantly related to approach and avoidance motivational constructs identifying two possible sources of contamination in self-report measures of motivational traits. Measurement items may be contaminated with implied outcomes and measurement items may be contaminated with generalized self-efficacy. In the second study, a within-subjects experiment tested the predictive validity of the vigilance measurement scale for task-specific self-efficacy and performance on a task that rewards avoidance-oriented strategies. Vigilance predicted prevention task-specific self-efficacy ( = .29) in one of two experimental conditions. The validation study also offered construct validity evidence for the vigilance construct.

This dissertation is focused on plasmon-enhanced second harmonic generation of organic ionic self-assembled films via localized surface plasmon resonance of gold nanorods. By matching the plasmon resonance of the gold nanorods to the wavelength of the fundamental light, it is possible to greatly enhance the SHG efficiency. To demonstrate this, the surface of the gold nanorods was functionalized with a nonlinear-optical (NLO) polymer, PCBS, via the layer-by-layer method and deposited on a polymer thin film created on a glass substrate using the ionic self-assembled multilayer (ISAM) method.  \tThe sample fabrication is divided into two partsgold nanorod synthesis and functionalization. The gold nanorods were synthesized by the seed-mediated method with varying amounts of silver ions to control their LSPR wavelengths. The functionalization started by replacing the original thick CTAB bilayer on the surface of the gold nanorods by a thin PAH-DTC layer via dialysis. The nanorods were then alternately coated with PAH (polycation) and PCBS (NLO polyanion) up to three bilayers of PAH/PCBS. The number of polymer layers on the nanorods was chosen in consideration of the LSPR decay length (a few nm). The functionalized gold nanorods were then deposited on either PAH/PCBS or PAH/PSS ISAM films.  \tCharacterization was performed via optical spectral measurement, zeta potential measurement, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The LSPR wavelength shifted when the surrounding medium changed. It was red-shifted for each added polymer layer on the nanorod surface. However, when the functionalized nanorods were deposited on the ISAM film, the resonance peak blue-shifted. The zeta potential confirmed the proper electric charge of each polymer layer coated on the nanorods. Finally, FESEM was performed on the samples for visual inspection of the nanorod deposition and distribution after the SHG measurement was complete. \tThe SHG from the functionalized gold nanorods was measured using a Maker-like fringe method. In this method, second harmonic waves generated from the front and rear sides of the substrate interfere constructively and destructively when the sample is rotated with respect to the incoming pump wave. Electrical noise reduction techniques were implemented to improve the SHG signal readings. Signal processing was implemented using LabVIEW software in order to read a reliable SHG signal from the setup. The maximum tolerable fluence of the gold nanorods was determined in order to prevent optical damage. The interference fringe pattern was observed from the functionalized gold nanorods and compared with that from the conventional ISAM film. The enhancement from the gold nanorods was as high as 600 times compared to the bare films. Polarization dependent SHG measurements were conducted to ascertain the effect of coupling between p- or s-polarized fundamental incident light to the SH light. To further improve the SHG enhancement, the self-assembly method herein can be extended from a monolayer to multilayers of functionalized gold nanorods.\",","111":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","112":"\"description-provenance\": [","113":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-10T09:00:21Z (GMT).

Surprisingly, however, the biophysical mechanisms and biological substrate that underlie magnetic sensing are still not fully understood.  Moreover, while use of magnetic cues for compass orientation is intuitive, the functional significance of other forms of behavioral responses mediated by magnetic cues, such as spontaneous magnetic alignment, is less clear. The following research was carried out to investigate the mechanisms underlying magnetic orientation in vertebrates and invertebrates.  This involved the modification of existing experimental systems to characterize responses to magnetic cues in laboratory animals (flies, mice) and the development of novel techniques for studying the role of magnetic cues in the spatial behavior of free-living animals (red foxes). Chapter II examines magnetic orientation in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We show that three strains of larvae reared under non-directional ultraviolet (UV) light exhibit quadramodal spontaneous orientation along the anti-cardinal compass directions (i.e. northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest) when tested in a radially symmetrical environment under UV light. Double-blind experiments cancelling the horizontal component of the magnetic field confirmed that the response is dependent on magnetic cues rather non-magnetic features of the test environment. Furthermore, we argue that the larval quadramodal pattern of response is consistent with properties of magnetic compass orientation observed in previous studies of adult Drosophila and laboratory mice, both of which have been proposed to be mediated by a light-dependent magnetic compass mechanism. Chapter III explores the use of novel biologging techniques to collect behavioral and spatial data from free-roaming mammals. Specifically, a previous observational study of free- roaming red foxes found a 4-fold increase in the success of predatory 'mousing' attacks when foxes were facing ~north-northeast, consistent with magnetic alignment responses reported for a range of terrestrial animals. The authors propose that the magnetic field may be used to increase accuracy of mousing attacks. Using tri-axial accelerometer and magnetometer bio-loggers fitted to semi-domesticated red foxes, we created ']magnetic ethograms' from behavioral and magnetic machine learning algorithms 'trained'] to identify three discrete behaviors (i.e. foraging, trotting, and mousing-like jumps) from raw accelerometer signatures and to classify the magnetic headings of mousing-like jumps into 45\u00b0 sectors from raw magnetometer data.  The classifier's ability to accurately identify behaviors from a separate fox not used to train the algorithm suggests that these techniques can be used in future experiments to obtain reliable magnetic ethograms for free-roaming foxes. We also developed the first radio-frequency emitting collar that broadcasts in the low MHz frequency range shown to disrupt magnetic compass responses in a host of animals. The radio-frequency collars coupled with biologgers will provide a powerful tool to characterize magnetic alignment responses in predatory red foxes and can be adapted for use in studies of magnetic alignment and magnetic compass orientation in other free-roaming mammals. Chapter 3 discusses findings from a magnetic nest building assay involving male labratory mice. Mice trained to position nests in one of four directions relative to the magnetic field exhibited both learned magnetic compass responses and fixed magnetic nest positioning orientation consistent with northeast-southwest spontaneous magnetic alignment behavior previously reported for wild mice and bank voles. This is the first mammalian assay in which both learned magnetic compass orientation and spontaneous magnetic alignment were exhibited in the same species, and suggests that the use of magnetic cues in rodents may be more flexible that previously realized.\",","160":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","161":"\"description-provenance\": [","162":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-10T09:00:28Z (GMT).

As the penetration levels of distributed generation increase, power systems will become increasingly decentralized with bi-directional flow of electricity between the transmission and distribution networks. To manage such decentralized power systems, planners and operators need models that accurately reflect the structure of, and interactions between the transmission and distribution networks. Moreover, algorithms that can simulate the steady state and dynamics of power systems using these models are also needed. In this context, integrated transmission and distribution system modeling and simulation has become an important research area in recent years, and the primary focus so far has been on studying the steady state response of power systems using integrated transmission and distribution system models.   The primary objective of this dissertation is to develop an analysis approach and a program that can simulate the dynamics of three phase, integrated transmission and distribution system models, and use the program to demonstrate the advantages of evaluating the impact of solar PV-based distributed generation on power systems dynamics using such models. To realize this objective, a new dynamic simulation analysis approach is presented, the implementation of the approach in a program is discussed, and verification studies are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the program. A new dynamic model for small solar PV-based distributed generation is also investigated. This model can interface with unbalanced networks and change its real power output according to the incident solar irradiation. Finally, application of the dynamic simulation program for evaluating the impact of solar PV units using an integrated transmission and distribution system model is discussed.   The dissertation presents a new approach for studying the impact of solar PV-based distributed generation on power systems dynamics, and demonstrates that the solar PV impact studies performed using the program and integrated transmission and distribution system models provide insights about the dynamic response of power systems that cannot be obtained using traditional dynamic simulation approaches that rely on transmission only models.\",","302":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","303":"\"description-provenance\": [","304":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-11T09:00:22Z (GMT).

Both questions require precise estimation of adsorbed phase capacity of gases (methane and carbon dioxide) and their adsorption behavior in shale and coal. This dissertation therefore analyzes adsorption isotherms, thermodynamics, and kinetics properties of methane and carbon dioxide in shale and coal based on experimental results to provide preliminary answers to both questions.  It was found that the dual-site Langmuir model can describe both methane and carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms in shale and coal under high pressure and high temperature conditions (up to 27 MPa and 355.15K). This allows for accurate estimation of the true methane and carbon dioxide GIP content and the relative quantity of adsorbed phases of gases at in situ temperatures and pressures representative of deep shale formations and coal seams. The concept of a deep shale gas reservoir is then proposed to optimize shale gas development methodology based on the successful application of the model for methane adsorption in shale.  Based on the dual-site Langmuir model, the isosteric heat of adsorption is calculated analytically by considering both the real gas behavior and the adsorbed phase under high pressure, both of which are ignored in the classic Clausius\ufffd\ufffd\\"Clapeyron approximation. It was also found that the isosteric heat of adsorption in Henry's pressure region is independent of temperature and can serve as a quantified index to evaluate the methane adsorption affinity on coal.  In order to understand the dynamic response of gas adsorption in coal for carbon sequestration, both gas adsorption kinetics and pore structure of coal are investigated. The pseudo-second order model is applied to simulate the adsorption kinetics of carbon dioxide in coals under different pressures. Coal particle size effects on pore characterization of coal and carbon dioxide and nitrogen ad/desorption behavior in coal was also investigated.\",","348":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","349":"\"description-provenance\": [","350":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-11T09:00:43Z (GMT).

Lifestyle management programs that combine diet, physical activity, and intensive behavioral therapy have been shown by research to support a degree of weight loss that produces health benefits (i.e., at least a 3-5% initial body weight). However, it has been difficult for research-developed programs to be delivered in typical practice to have a meaningful impact. Integrated research-practice partnerships that involve the coming together of academic researchers, health system administrators, and program delivery staff may help overcome this gap, especially during this transformational time in the healthcare sector. This dissertation aimed to develop an understanding of how using the integrated research-practice approach would facilitate and sustain evidence-based lifestyle management strategies across a health system to treat obesity among patients and employees.       An integrated research-practice partnership with Carilion Clinic, a health system in western Virginia, served as an example for the study. From 2013-2016, the Carilion Clinic integrated research-practice partnership conducted a series of trials testing different strategies for delivering weight loss and weight loss maintenance support. An evaluation guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework was conducted to describe implementation processes and outcomes for each strategy. Lessons learned from the evaluation support the value of the integrated-research practice partnership approach as a solution for overcoming gaps in obesity care. A shared priority perspective between research and practice was identified as the powerful process for supporting facilitation and sustainability of strategies. In addition, findings from the evaluation produced evidence to inform the future development of a system for Carilion Clinic to help patients and employees lose weight and keep it off through lifestyle management.\",","397":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","398":"\"description-provenance\": [","399":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-11T09:00:57Z (GMT).

Several researchers have studied other educators' knowledge of school law.  In general, previous studies on educators' knowledge of school law demonstrates that educators do not have a comprehensive working knowledge of school law.  ADs differ from those studied previously due to the lack of unified certification requirements for ADs in the Commonwealth of Virginia.   This study was designed to measure Virginia interscholastic ADs' knowledge of job related school law.  In addition, the study analyzed the data for any significant relationships between ADs' knowledge of school law and other variables.  Such variables include age, experience, size of school district, level of education, administration and supervision endorsement, type of legal training, methods for obtaining current school law information and/or updates, membership in professional organizations, national certification level. Of the 315 Virginia public high school Ads, 305 were surveyed and 140 responded, for a response rate of 45.9%.  Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and ANOVA analysis.  Statistical analysis revealed that ADs in larger schools scored significantly higher than ADs in smaller schools.  Also, ADs with that possessed the 'Certified Athletic Administrator' (CAA) credential scored significantly higher than ADs that have not attained the CAA certification.  Lastly, ADs that are members of both the state and national ADs association (VIAAA and NIAAA, respectively) scored significantly higher than ADs who are not members of both associations.\",","444":"\"description-degree\": \"EDD\",","445":"\"description-provenance\": [","446":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-18T09:00:11Z (GMT).

These buildings offer excellent opportunities for energy saving and demand response (DR), but these opportunities are rarely utilized due to lack of effective building energy management systems and automated algorithms that can assist a building to participate in a DR program. Considering the low load factor in US and many other countries, DR can serve as an effective tool to reduce peak demand through demand-side load curtailment. A convenient option for the customer to benefit from a DR program is to use automated DR algorithms within a software that can learn user comfort preferences for the building loads and make automated load curtailment decisions without affecting customer comfort. The objective of this dissertation is to provide such a solution. First, this dissertation contributes to the development of key features of a building energy management open source software platform that enable ease-of-use through plug and play and interoperability of devices in a building, cost-effectiveness through deployment in a low-cost computer, and DR through communication infrastructure between building and utility and among multiple buildings, while ensuring security of the platform. Second, a set of reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithms is proposed for the three main types of loads in a buildingheating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) loads, lighting loads and plug loads. In absence of a DR program, these distributed agent-based learning algorithms are designed to learn the user comfort ranges through explorative interaction with the environment and accumulating user feedback, and then operate through policies that favor maximum user benefit in terms of saving energy while ensuring comfort. Third, two sets of DR algorithms are proposed for an incentive-based DR program in a building. A user-defined priority based DR algorithm with smart thermostat control and utilization of distributed energy resources (DER) is proposed for residential buildings. For commercial buildings, a learning-based algorithm is proposed that utilizes the learning from the RL algorithms to use a pre-cooling/pre-heating based load reduction method for HVAC loads and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based optimization method for other loads to dynamically maintain total building demand below a demand limit set by the utility during a DR event, while minimizing total user discomfort. A user defined priority based DR algorithm is also proposed for multiple buildings in a community so that they can participate in realizing combined DR objectives. The software solution proposed in this dissertation is expected to encourage increased participation of smaller and medium-sized buildings in demand response and energy saving activities. This will help in alleviating power system stress conditions by employing the untapped DR potential in such buildings.\",","489":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","490":"\"description-provenance\": [","491":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-25T09:00:16Z (GMT).

High PV penetration can create overvoltages and voltage fluctuations in the network, which are major concerns for the grid operator. Traditional voltage control devices like switched capacitor banks or line voltage regulators can alleviate slow-moving fluctuations, but these devices need to operate more frequently than usual when PV generation fluctuates due to fast cloud movements. Such frequent operations will impact the life expectancy of these voltage control devices. Advanced PV inverter functionalities enable solar PV systems to provide reliable grid support through controlled real injection and/or reactive power compensation. This dissertation proposes a voltage regulation technique to mitigate probable impacts of high PV penetrations on the distribution voltage profile using smart inverter functionalities. A droop-based reactive power compensation method with active power curtailment is proposed, which uses the local voltage regulation at the inverter end. This technique is further augmented with very short-term PV generation forecasts. A hybrid forecasting algorithm is proposed here which is based on measurement-dependent dynamic modeling of PV systems using the Kalman Filter theory. Physical modeling of the PV system is utilized by this forecasting algorithm. Because of the rise in distributed PV systems, modeling of geographic dispersion is also addressed under PV system modeling. The proposed voltage regulation method is coordinated with existing voltage regulator operations to reduce required number of tap-change operations. Control settings of the voltage regulators are adjusted to achieve minimal number of tap-change operations within a predefined time window. Finally, integration of energy storage is studied to highlight the value of the proposed voltage regulation technique vis-\u00e0-vis increased solar energy use.\",","535":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","536":"\"description-provenance\": [","537":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-25T09:00:24Z (GMT).

Within Rhinolophid and Hipposiderid families, bats actively deform their pinnae and noseleaf during biosonar operation. Both the pinnae and noseleaf act as acoustic baffles which interact with the outgoing and incoming sound; thus, they form an important interface between the bat and its environment. Beampatterns describe this interface as joint time-frequency transfer functions which vary across spatial direction.  This dissertation considers bat biosonar shape diversity and shape dynamics manifest as beampatterns. In the first part, the seemingly disparate set of functional properties resulting from diverse pinnae and noseleaf shape adaptations are considered. The question posed in this part is as follows(i) what are the common properties between species beampatterns? and (ii) how are beampatterns aligned to a common direction for meaningful analysis?  Hence, a quantitative interspecific analysis of the beampattern biodiversity was taken wherein(i) unit[267]{} different pinnae and noseleaf beampatterns were rotationally aligned to a common direction and (ii) decomposed using principal component analysis, PCA. The first three principal components termed eigenbeams affect beamwidth around the single lobe, symmetric mean beampattern.   Dynamic shape adaptations to the pinnae and noseleaf of the greater horseshoe bat (textit{Rhinolophus ferrumequinum}) are also considered. However, the underlying dynamic sensing principles in use are not clear. Hence, this work developed a biomimetic substrate to explore the emission and reception dynamics of the horseshoe bat as a sonar device. The question posed in this part was as followshow do local features on the noseleaf and pinnae interact individually and when combined together to generate peak dynamic change to the incoming sonar information? Flexible noseleaf and pinnae baffles with different combinations of local shape features were developed. These baffles were then mounted to platforms to biomimetically actuate the noseleaf and pinnae during pulse emission and reception. Motions of the baffle surfaces were synchronized to the incoming and outgoing sonar waveform, and the time-frequency properties of the emission and reception baffles were characterized across spatial direction. Different feature combinations of the noseleaf and pinnae local shape features were ranked for overall dynamic effect.\",","583":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","584":"\"description-provenance\": [","585":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-25T09:00:31Z (GMT).

Revitalization and gentrification drive these transformations as wealthy Panamanians invest in the neighborhood, and affluent foreigners flock to it since it became a World Heritage Site in 1997. This dissertation addresses perceptions and reactions residents have because of these physical, economic and social challenges.     This study poses four main questions1. What physical, economic, and social (quality of life) changes have taken place in the Historic District of San Felipe from the early twentieth century to the present? To what extent are these changes the result of global processes, local processes, or both? 2. How do residents perceive these changes? Is there any significant difference in opinions and attitudes among residents regarding changes that revitalization and gentrification impose on the neighborhood? If so, how and why are they different? 3. To what extent have residents participated in these transformations? and 4. How do residents who have been relocated perceive these changes?     My research analyzes Smith's five characteristics of a third wave of gentrificationfirst, the transformed role of the state; second, the penetration by global finance; third, changing levels of political opposition; fourth, geographical dispersal; and fifth, the sectoral generalization of gentrification and its relevance for my case study of San Felipe.     This methodology enlists quantitative and qualitative methods to address these research questions to gain insight about residents' perspectives regarding these transformations. Findings indicate that both residents and ex-residents of San Felipe view the outcomes of revitalization and gentrification in mixed ways. Both groups mostly agree that the improvement of the physical conditions of the neighborhood is a positive outcome for preserving the material heritage, and for encouraging international and national tourism benefiting the country.    Regardless of their economic and social status, residents claim that the place where they have lived for a long time is no longer theirs, except in their memories. They face the threat of eviction and an uncertain future. Former residents\u2014those who have been displaced\u2014have mixed views as well. On the one hand, they have improved their living standards because they now have better housing infrastructures. On the other hand, their new locations are scattered about the city and are often in dangerous areas that lack the amenities of San Felipe. Others feel that in the process they have lost a home; a place filled with meaningful memories and to which one day they dream of returning.     A diverse residential population is the only way to save historic centers from becoming museums that present a pastiche and a 'fa\u00e7adism' catered to the international consumer. Preserving the human and physical patrimony is the most viable way to achieve sustainability and development in historic areas.    Associations had no permanent places to meet with residents. This eroded the desire of residents to participate, and encouraged them to accept whatever owners wanted to give them to move out of the neighborhood. In the end, they became disenfranchised.     A lack of both leadership and strong social movements, and the dissemblance of grass-root organizations through co-optation, clientelism, and even deception became the norm in the neighborhood.\",","629":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","630":"\"description-provenance\": [","631":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-25T09:00:39Z (GMT).

The model form uncertainty quantification utilizes equation error to estimate the error between an identified model and flight test results. The errors are then related to aircraft states, and prediction intervals are calculated. This method for model form uncertainty quantification results in uncertainty bounds that vary with the aircraft state, narrower where consistent information has been collected and wider where data are not available.  Non-deterministic simulations can then be performed to provide uncertainty quantified estimates of the system performance.  The model form uncertainties could be time varying, so multiple sampling methods were considered.  The two methods utilized were a fixed uncertainty level and a rate bounded variation in the uncertainty level. For analysis using fixed uncertainty level, the corner points of the model form uncertainty were sampled, providing reduced computational time.  The second model better represents the uncertainty but requires significantly more simulations to sample the uncertainty.  The uncertainty quantified performance estimates are compared to estimates based on flight tests to check the accuracy of the results.  Sensitivity analysis is performed on the uncertainty quantified performance estimates to provide information on which of the model form uncertainties contribute most to the uncertainty in the performance estimates.   The proposed method uses the results from the fixed uncertainty level analysis that utilizes the corner points of the model form uncertainties.  The sensitivity of each parameter is estimated based on corner values of all the other uncertain parameters.  This results in a range of possible sensitivities for each parameter dependent on the true value of the other parameters.\",","676":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","677":"\"description-provenance\": [","678":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-25T09:00:47Z (GMT).

One example area is distributed optical fiber sensing, which has been attracting research interests for decades. Optical fiber sensors are immune to electromagnetic interference, and resistant to corrosion and can endure harsh environment so they have found applications such as structural health monitoring, intrusion detection and oil downhole measurement. Significant research efforts have been paid to fiber sensing area, many techniques have been developed and some of them have been successfully demonstrated, however achieving both high-speed and long-range is still under intensive research.  This dissertation proposes and demonstrates a technique with the capability of simultaneous long-range and high-speed sensing by employing serial ultra-weak fiber Bragg gratings (UW-FBGs) and dispersive components. Various factors which have influence on the system performance, including wavelength resolution, spatial resolution and sensing rate, are analyzed. Different types of light sources and dispersive units were designed and a sensing system was built. With this system, both static and dynamic response were measured, and a sensing link consisting of more than 2000 UW-FBGs was successfully measured at the speed of 20kHz. The noise sources of the system were also theoretically analyzed and experimentally measured. This demonstrated sensing technique can be applied to long range temperature and strain sensing.\",","720":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","721":"\"description-provenance\": [","722":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-26T09:00:16Z (GMT).

Current treatments for SLE are often intensive and result in side effects and the potential for continued flares and progression of disease.  Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes control multiple cellular functions by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues in various proteins.  HDAC inhibitors have been investigated as a potential treatment for SLE with promising results, however selective HDAC6 inhibition (HDAC6i) has become a leading candidate for pharmacologic inhibition to reduce the potential for side effects.  We hypothesize that HDAC6i will decrease SLE disease by targeting substrates of HDAC6 in multiple components of immunity and organ systems.  NZB/W mice were treated with ACY-738 or ACY-1083, followed by evaluation of multiple disease parameters and mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis within the kidney, bone marrow, and spleen.  Within the kidney, HDAC6i decreased glomerular pathology scores, proteinuria, and IgG and C3 deposition.  Within glomerular cells, HDAC6i increased alpha-tubulin acetylation and decreased nuclear NF-\u03baB.  Within the spleen, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency of Th17 cells and a mild decrease in the frequency of Treg cells.  Concurrently, there were decreased levels of IL-12/IL-23 and minimal decreases in TGF-\u03b2 in the serum.  Within the bone marrow, B cell development through Hardy fractions exhibited accelerated progression through later stages as NZB/W mice aged.  This accelerated progression may allow B cells to bypass important regulatory checkpoints in maintaining immune tolerance and contribute to autoimmunity.  Treatment with an HDAC6i corrected the aberrant B cell development in the bone marrow and RNAseq analysis unveiled six genes (Cebpb, Ccr9, Spib, Nfil3, Lgals1, and Pou2af1) that may play a role in the aforementioned abnormalities.    Overall, these findings show that HDAC6i decreased disease in NZB/W mice by targeting multiple components of the immune response, including glomerular cells, T cell subsets in the spleen, and bone marrow B cells. In conclusion, selective HDAC6i is an excellent candidate for pharmacologic therapy for SLE because it targets multiple immune abnormalities involved in SLE pathogenesis while remaining selective and safe.\",","820":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","821":"\"description-provenance\": [","822":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-31T09:00:44Z (GMT).

This research adopts a numerical approach to study seismic performance of soil-cement columnar reinforcements in loose sandy profiles. Different constitutive models were investigated in order to find a model that can properly predict soil behavior during seismic excitations. These models included NorSand, Dafalias-Manzari, Plasticity Model for Sands (PM4Sand) and Pressure-Dependent-Multi-Yield-02 (PDMY02) model. They were employed to predict behavior of soils with different relative densities and under different confining pressures during monotonic and cyclic loading. PDMY02 was identified as the most suitable model to represent soil seismic behavior for the system studied herein. The numerical aspects of the finite element approach were investigated to minimize the unintended numerical miscalculations. The focus was put on convergence tolerance, solver time-step, constraint definition, and, integration, material and Rayleigh damping. This resulted in forming a robust numerical configuration for 3-D nonlinear models that were later used for studying behavior of the reinforced grounds.  Nonlinear finite element models were developed to capture the seismic response of columnar reinforced ground during dynamic centrifuge testing. The models were calibrated with results from tests with unreinforced profiles. Thereafter, they were implemented to predict the response of two reinforced profiles during seismic excitations with different intensities and liquefaction triggering. Model predictions were compared with recordings and the possible effects from the reinforcements were discussed. Finally, parametric studies were performed to further evaluate the efficiency of the reinforcements with different extension depths and area replacement ratios.  The results collectively showed that the stiff elements, if constructed appropriately, can withstand seismic excitations with different intensities, and provide a firm base for overlying structures. However, the presence of the stiff elements within the loose ground resulted in stronger seismic intensities on the soil surface. The columns were not able to considerably reduce pore water pressure generation, nor prevent liquefaction triggering. The reinforced profiles, comparing to the free-field profiles, had larger settlements on the soil surface but smaller settlements on the columns. The results concluded that utilization of the columnar reinforcements requires great attention as these reinforcements may result in larger seismic intensities at the ground surface, while not considerably reducing the ground deformations.\",","865":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","866":"\"description-provenance\": [","867":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-01T09:00:42Z (GMT).

Recently, orchardgrass producers in the Mid-Atlantic have reported a reduction in the persistence and regrowth vigor of their swards. The overall objective was to evaluate which factors play a major role in controlling the persistence of orchardgrass harvested for hay in the Mid-Atlantic. A survey of orchardgrass fields, growth chamber experiment, and field experiment were conducted to that end. The objectives were to(1) assess soil fertility, management practices, disease status, and climate in relation to producer perceived stand persistence rating, orchardgrass biomass, and soil test thresholds in orchardgrass hayfields in 4 states, (2) examine the interactions of high temperature and low cutting height on the physiology and regrowth of orchardgrass in controlled environments, and (3) evaluate yield, composition, and size/density compensation-corrected productivity of orchardgrass and orchardgrass/alfalfa mixtures harvested to four cutting heights over three years. The survey of hayfields indicated that the sward age, soil organic matter, grazing, manure application, and historical average high temperature were main determinants of stand persistence score. In the growth chamber experiment, regrowth was significantly reduced by the 35\u00b0C treatment as compared to 20\u00b0C. Low cutting height significantly reduced regrowth in the cool temperature treatment, but no effect of cutting height was detected under heat stress. In the field experiment, yields were highest from plots cut to 5 cm, but orchardgrass cover in these plots thinned through the experiment. Tiller size and density measurements indicated that cutting heights of 10 cm or greater were able to achieve and maintain optimal leaf area while productivity was reduced for the 5 cm treatment. Overall, it is apparent that excessively low cutting heights are a major cause of reduced persistence in orchardgrass swards and that high temperature stress will limit regrowth. These factors likely interact with fertility and disease status, and together cause the premature loss of orchardgrass stands. Efforts should be made to communicate the importance of increased cutting height to producers. Breeding of orchardgrass resistant to fungal pathogens and heat stress may be required to sustain an orchardgrass hay industry in the Mid-Atlantic.\",","913":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","914":"\"description-provenance\": [","915":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-01T09:01:06Z (GMT).

Component-based structural design proceeds on a member to member basis, insuring acceptable failure probabilities for every single structural member without explicitly assessing the overall system safety, whereas structural failure consequences are related to the whole system performance (the cost of a building or a bridge destroyed by an earthquake) rather than a single beam or column failure. Engineering intuition tells us that the system is safer than each individual component due to the likelihood of load redistribution and al- ternate load paths, however such conservatism cannot be guaranteed without an explicit system-level safety check. As a result, component-based structural designs can lead to both over-conservative components and a less-than-anticipated system reliability.  System performance depends on component properties as well as the load-sharing network, which can possess a wide range of behaviors varying from a dense redundant system with scope for load redistribution after failure initiates, to a weakest-link type network that fails as soon as the first member exceeds its capacity. The load-sharing network is characterized by its overall system reliability and the system-reliability sensitivity, which quantifies the change in system safety due to component reliability modifications. A general algorithm is proposed to calculate modified component reliabilities using the sensitivity vector for the load-sharing network. The modifications represent an improvement on the structural properties of more critical components (more capacity, better ductility), and provide savings on less important members which do not play a significant role.  The general methodology is applied to light steel-framed buildings under seismic loads. The building is modeled with non-linear spring elements representing its subsystems. The stochastic response of this model under seismic ground motions provides load-sharing, system reliability and sensitivity information, which are used to propose target diaphragm and shear wall reliability to meet a building reliability goal. Finally, diaphragm target reliability is used to propose modified component designs using stochastic simulations on geometric and materially non-linear finite-element models including every individual component.\",","958":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","959":"\"description-provenance\": [","960":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-01T09:01:17Z (GMT).

To develop pertinent research objectives, background information on this pest was gathered from literature sources and personal communications with growers, extension agents and other agricultural professionals.  In objective one, Mexican bean beetle preference, developmental success and plant injury were compared among three snap bean and three lima bean cultivars in field and greenhouse trials.  The cultivar 'Dragon's Tongue' was the most preferred, suitable for development, and prone to injury.  Growers may benefit from growing less susceptible cultivars, or by using 'Dragon's Tongue' in trap cropping or push-pull strategies.  In objective two, Mexican bean beetle densities, feeding injury, and yield were compared among snap beans grown on metallized plastic (highly reflective), white plastic, black plastic, and bare soil.  Metallized plastic provided the greatest level of control, and resulted in the highest yields.  Managing Mexican bean beetle by growing beans on metallized plastic may be used as a stand-alone method, or in a push-pull strategy.  In the final objective, the effects of snap beans grown from thiamethoxam (a neonicotinoid insecticide)-treated seeds on Mexican bean beetle were assessed in greenhouse and field experiments.  Thiamethoxam-treated plants killed 40 to 50% of Mexican bean beetle adults and larvae up to 16 days after planting.  In the field, thiamethoxam-treated plants mitigated Mexican bean beetle densities and damage in one out of five experiments, resulting in a yield increase.  In none of the five field experiments were differences detected in predatory arthropod species between thiamethoxam and non-insecticide treated beans.  In summary, the results of this project suggest that non-chemical management methods, such as cultivar selection and planting beans on reflective mulch, can provide effective control of Mexican bean beetle.  Thiamethoxam-treated seed may also provide control of this pest, but only within two to three weeks after planting; otherwise, there is typically no effect on beetles, injury or yield.  This doctoral research has laid a foundation for an integrated pest management approach for Mexican bean beetle.\",","1008":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1009":"\"description-provenance\": [","1010":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-01T09:01:31Z (GMT).

Despite progress in numerical simulations, producing accurate models that can predict these complex behaviors are still encumbered by lengthy processing times. Accurate models can be produced quickly by utilizing projection Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) techniques. For discretized systems, the Singular Value Decomposition technique is the preferred approach but has had limited success on treating nonlinearities. In this research, the treatment of nonlinear temperature dependent material properties was incorporated into a ROM. Additional sources of nonlinearities such as radiation boundary conditions, temperature dependent source heating terms, and complex geometry were also integrated. From the results, low conductivity, highly nonlinear material properties were predicted by the ROM within 1% of full order models, and additional nonlinearities were predicted within 8%. A study was then done to identify initial snapshots for use in developing a ROM that can accurately predict results across a wide range of inputs. From this, a step function was identified as being the most accurate and computationally efficient. The ROM was further investigated by a discretization study to assess computational gains in both 1D and 3D models as a function of mesh density. The lower mesh densities in the 1D and 3D ROMs resulted in moderate computational times (up to 40 times faster). However, highly discretized systems such as 5000 nodes in 1D and 125000 nodes in 3D resulted in computational gains on the order of 2000 to 3000 times faster than the full order model.\",","1063":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1064":"\"description-provenance\": [","1065":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-02T09:00:24Z (GMT).

However, these advances have also contributed to the increased possibility of \\"rogue\\" transmitter radios which may cause significant interference to other radios in DSS. One approach for countering such threats is to employ a transmitter authentication scheme at the physical (PHY) layer. In PHY-layer authentication, an authentication signal is generated by the transmitter, and embedded into the message signal. This enables a regulatory enforcement entity to extract the authentication signal from the received signal, uniquely identify a transmitter, and collect verifiable evidence of a rogue transmission that can be used later during an adjudication process. There are two primary technical challenges in devising a transmitter authentication scheme for DSS(1) how to generate and verify the authentication signal such that the required security and privacy criteria are met; and (2) how to embed and extract the authentication signal without negatively impacting the performance of the transmitters and the receivers in DSS. With regard to dealing with the first challenge, the authentication schemes in the prior art, which provide privacy-preserving authentication, have limited practical value for use in large networks due to the high computational complexity of their revocation check procedures. In this dissertation, the novel approaches which significantly improve scalability of the transmitter authentication with respect to revocation, are proposed. With regard to dealing with the second challenge, in the existing PHY-layer authentication techniques, the authentication signal is embedded into the message signal in such a way that the authentication signal appears as noise to the message signal and vice versa. Hence, existing schemes are constrained by a fundamental tradeoff between the message signal's signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) and the authentication signal's SINR. In this dissertation, the novel approaches which are not constrained by the aforementioned tradeoff between message and authentication signals, are proposed.\",","1111":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1112":"\"description-provenance\": [","1113":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-03T09:00:29Z (GMT).

Specialty crop producers, especially ornamental crop producers, must continually improve production sustainability, with regards to water resource management, in order to continue to stay economically viable. Soilless substrates were initially developed to have increased porosity and relatively low water holding capacity to ensure container crops would not remain overhydrated after irrigations or rain events. As a result, substrates were selected that are now considered to be in efficient in regards to water resource management. Therefore, to provide growers with additional means to improve production sustainability, soilless substrate hydrology needs be innovated to provide increased water availability while continuing to provide ample air filled porosity to ensure productive and efficient water interactions. Historically, soilless substrates have been characterized using \\"static\\" physical properties (i.e. maximum water holding capacity and minimum air-filled porosity). The research herein involves integrating dynamic soilless substrate hydraulic properties to understand how substrate hydrology can be manipulated to design sustainable substrates. This task involved adapting new technologies to analyze hydrological properties of peat and pine bark substrates by employing evaporative moisture characteristic measurements, which were originally designed for mineral soils, for soilless substrate analyses. Utilizing these evaporative measurements provide more accurate measures of substrate water potentials between -10 and -800 hPa than traditional pressure plate measurements. Soilless substrates were engineered, utilizing only three common substrate components [stabilized pine bark (Pinus taedea L.), Sphagnum peatmoss, and coconut coir fiber], via particle fractionation and fibrous additions. The engineering process yielded substrates with increased unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, pore connectivity, and more uniform pore size distributions. These substrates were tested in a greenhouse with irrigation systems designed to hold substrates at (-100 to -300 hPa) or approaching (-50 to -100 hPa) water potentials associated with drought stress. Substrate-water dynamics were monitored, as were plant morphology and drought stress indicators. It was determined that increased substrate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity within the production water potentials, allowed for increased crop growth, reduction in drought stress indicators, while producing marketable plants. Furthermore, individual plants were produced using as low as 5.3 L per plant. Increased production range substrate hydraulic conductivity was able to maintain necessary levels of air-filled porosity due to reduced irrigation volumes, while providing water for plants when needed. The substrates were able to conduct water from throughout the container volume to the plant roots for uptake when roots reduced substrate water potential. Furthermore, increased substrate hydraulic conductivity allowed plants within the substrate to continue absorbing water at much lower water potentials than those in unaltered (control) pine bark. Finally, HYDRUS models were utilized to simulate water flux through containerized substrates. These models allowed for better understanding of how individual hydraulic properties influence substrate water flux, and provided insight towards proportions of inaccessible pores, which do not maintain sufficient levels of available water. With the models, researchers will be able to simulate new substrates, and utilize model predictions to provide insight toward new substrates prior to implementing production tests.

The objective of this dissertation is to develop an AHP (analytic hierarchy process) - based strategy for demand curtailment allocation that is subject to communications and cyber security limitations. Specifically, it(1) proposes an electrical demand curtailment allocation strategy to keep the balance between supply and demand in case of the sudden supply shortage; (2) simulates the operation of the proposed demand curtailment allocation strategy considering the impact from communication network limitations and simultaneous operations of multiple smart grid applications sharing the same communication network; and (3) analyzes the performance of the proposed demand curtailment allocation strategy when selected cyber security technologies are implemented. These are explained in more details below.  An AHP-based approach to electrical demand curtailment allocation management is proposed, which determines load reduction amounts at various segments of the network to maintain the balance between generation and demand. Appropriate communication technologies and the network topology are used to implement these load reduction amounts down to the end-user. In this proposed strategy, demand curtailment allocation is quantified taking into account the demand response potential and the load curtailment priority of each distribution substation. The proposed strategy helps allocate demand curtailment (MW) among distribution substations or feeders in an electric utility service area based on requirements of the central load dispatch center.   To determine how rapidly the proposed demand curtailment strategy can be implemented, the capability of the communication network supporting the demand curtailment implementation needs to be evaluated. To evaluate the capability of different communication technologies, selected communication technologies are compared in terms of their latency, throughput, reliability, power consumption and implementation costs. Since a number of smart grid applications share the same communication network, the performance of this communication network is also evaluated considering simultaneous operation of popular smart grid applications.  Lastly, limitations of using several cyber security technologies based on different encryption methods - 3EDS (Triple Data Encryption Standard), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), Blowfish, etc. - in deploying the proposed demand curtailment allocation strategy are analyzed.\",","1217":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1218":"\"description-provenance\": [","1219":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-04T09:01:08Z (GMT).

In particular, many techniques for locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) attempt to approximate real-world walking. However, it is not yet fully understood how the design of more realistic locomotion techniques influences effectiveness and user experience. In the previous VR studies, the effects of interaction fidelity have been coarse-grained, considering interaction fidelity as a single construct. We argue that interaction fidelity consists of various independent components, and each component can have a different effect on the effectiveness of the interface. Moreover, the designer's intent can influence the effectiveness of an interface and needs to be considered in the design. Semi-natural locomotion interfaces can be difficult to use at first, due to a lack of interaction fidelity, and effective training would help users understand the forces they were feeling and better control their movements. Another method to improve locomotion interaction is to develop a more effective interface or improve the existing techniques. A detailed taxonomy of walking-based locomotion techniques would be beneficial to better understand, analyze, and design walking techniques for VR. We conducted four user studies and performed a meta-analysis on the literature to have a more in-depth understanding of the effects of interaction fidelity on effectiveness. We found that for the measures dependent on proprioceptive sensory information, such as orientation estimation, cognitive load, and sense of presence, the level of effectiveness increases with increasing levels of interaction fidelity. Other measures which depend more on the ease of learning and ease of use, such as completion time, movement accuracy, and subjective evaluation, form a u-shape uncanny valley. For such measures, moderate-fidelity interfaces are often outperformed by low- and high-fidelity interfaces. In our third user study, we further investigated the effects of components of interaction fidelity, biomechanics and transfer function, as well as designers' intent. We learned that the biomechanics of walking are more sensitive to changes and that the effects of these changes were mostly negative for hyper-natural techniques. Changes in the transfer function component were easier for the user to learn and to adapt to. Suitable transfer functions were able to improve some locomotion features but at the cost of accuracy. To improve the level of effectiveness in moderate-fidelity locomotion interfaces we employed an effective training method. We learned that providing a visual cue during the acclimation phase can help users better understand their walking in moderate-fidelity interfaces and improve their effectiveness. To develop a design space and classification of locomotion techniques, we designed a taxonomy for walking- based locomotion techniques. With this taxonomy, we extract and discuss various characteristics of locomotion interaction. Researchers can create novel locomotion techniques by making choices from the components of this taxonomy, they can analyze and improve existing techniques, or perform experiments to evaluate locomotion techniques in detail using the presented organization. As an example of using this taxonomy, we developed a novel locomotion interface by choosing a new combination of characteristics from the taxonomy.\",","1262":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1263":"\"description-provenance\": [","1264":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:00:30Z (GMT).

For this, the bats emit brief ultrasonic pulses and listen to incoming echoes to learn about the environment. The sites of emission and reception in these bats are surrounded by baffle structures called \\"noseleaves\\" and \\"pinnae (outer ears)\\". These are the the only places in the biosonar system where direction-dependent information gets encoded. These baffle structures in bats unlike the engineering systems like megaphones have complex static geometry and can undergo fast deformations at the time of pulse emission/reception. However, the functional significance of the baffle motions in biosonar system is not known. The current work primarily focuses oni) the study of the impact of noseleaf dynamics on the outgoing sound waves, ii) the study of the impact of baffle dynamics on encoding of sensory information and localization performance of bats. For this, we take a numerical approach where we use computer-animated digital models of bat noseleaves that mimic noseleaf dynamics as observed in bats. The shapes are acoustically characterized (beampatterns) numerically using a finite element implementation. These beampatterns are then analyzed using an information-theoretic approach. The followings findings were obtainedi) noseleaf dynamics altered the spatial distribution of energy, ii) baffle dynamics results in encoding of new sensory information, and iii) the new sensory information encoded due to baffle dynamics significantly improves the performance of biosonar system on the two target localization tasks evaluated here -- direction resolution and direction estimation accuracy. These results affirm the importance of dynamics in biosonar system of horseshoe bats and point at the possibility of biosonar dynamics as a key factor behind the astounding sensory capabilities of these animals that are not yet matched by engineering systems. Thus, these biosonar dynamic principles can help improve the man-made sensing systems and help close the performance gap between active sensing in biology and in engineering.\",","1308":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1309":"\"description-provenance\": [","1310":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:01:17Z (GMT).

(1) discovering surprising patterns from multi-relational data, (2) constructing a generative model for multivariate categorical data, and (3) simultaneously modeling multivariate multi-response count data and estimating covariance structures between multiple responses.  To discover surprising multi-relational patterns, we first study the ``where do I start?'' problem originating from intelligence analysis. By studying nine methods with origins in association analysis, graph metrics, and probabilistic modeling, we identify several classes of algorithmic strategies that can supply starting points to analysts, and thus help to discover interesting multi-relational patterns from datasets. To actually mine for interesting multi-relational patterns, we represent the multi-relational patterns as dense and well-connected chains of biclusters over multiple relations, and model the discrete data by the maximum entropy principle, such that in a statistically well-founded way we can gauge the surprisingness of a discovered bicluster chain with respect to what we already know. We design an algorithm for approximating the most informative multi-relational patterns, and provide strategies to incrementally organize discovered patterns into the background model. We illustrate how our method is adept at discovering the hidden plot in multiple synthetic and real-world intelligence analysis datasets. Our approach naturally generalizes traditional attribute-based maximum entropy models for single relations, and further supports iterative, human-in-the-loop, knowledge discovery.  To build a generative model for multivariate categorical data, we apply the maximum entropy principle to propose a categorical maximum entropy model such that in a statistically well-founded way we can optimally use given prior information about the data, and are unbiased otherwise. Generally, inferring the maximum entropy model could be infeasible in practice. Here, we leverage the structure of the categorical data space to design an efficient model inference algorithm to estimate the categorical maximum entropy model, and we demonstrate how the proposed model is adept at estimating underlying data distributions. We evaluate this approach against both simulated data and US census datasets, and demonstrate its feasibility using an epidemic simulation application.  Modeling data with multivariate count responses is a challenging problem due to the discrete nature of the responses. Existing methods for univariate count responses cannot be easily extended to the multivariate case since the dependency among multiple responses needs to be properly accounted for. To model multivariate data with multiple count responses, we propose a novel multivariate Poisson log-normal model (MVPLN). By simultaneously estimating the regression coefficients and inverse covariance matrix over the latent variables with an efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithm, the proposed model takes advantages of association among multiple count responses to improve the model prediction accuracy. Simulation studies and applications to real world data are conducted to systematically evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with conventional methods.\",","1356":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1357":"\"description-provenance\": [","1358":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-08T09:00:32Z (GMT).

One of the potential applications of composite materials in vehicles is in energy-absorbing components such as hollow shells and struts (these components may be in the form of circular cylindrical shells, square and rectangular tubes, conical shells, and frusta). However, constructions which result in brittle fracture of the composite tubes in the form of circumferential or longitudinal corner crack propagation may lead to unstable collapse failure mode and concomitant very low energy absorption. As a result, metal-composite hollow tubes have been developed that combine the benefits of stable ductile collapse of the metal (which can absorb crushing energy in a controlled manner) and the high strength-to-weight ratio of the composites. The relative and absolute thicknesses of metal or FRP section has a substantial effect on energy absorption of the hybrid tubes. In particular, likelihood of delamination occurrence raises with increase in FRP thickness. This can reduce the energy absorption capability of the metal-FRP hybrid tubes. Additionally, adding a very thick FRP section may result in a global buckling failure mode (rather than local folding). Until now, there are no studies specifically addressing the effect of FRP thickness on energy absorption of hybrid tubes. In this study, the effects of fiber orientation and FRP thickness (the number of layers) on the energy absorption of S2-glass/epoxy-304 stainless steel square tubes were experimentally investigated. In addition, a new geometrical trigger was demonstrated which has positive effects on the collapse modes, delamination in the FRP, and the crush load efficiency of the hybrid tube.  To complete this study, a new methodology including the combination of experimental results, numerical modeling, and a multi-objective optimization process was introduced to obtain the best combination of design variables for hybrid metal-composite tubes for crashworthiness applications.  The experimental results for the S2 glass/epoxy-304 stainless steel square tubes with different configurations tested under quasi-static compression loading were used to validate numerical models implemented in LS-DYNA software. The models were able to capture progressive failure mechanisms of the hybrid tubes. In addition, the effects of the design variables on the energy absorption and failure modes of the hybrid tubes were explained. Subsequently, the results from the numerical models were used to obtain optimum crashworthiness functions. The load efficiency factor (the ratio of mean crushing load to maximum load) and ratio between the difference of mean crushing load of hybrid and metal tube and thickness of the FRP section were introduced as objective functions.  To connect the variables and the functions, back-propagation artificial neural networks (ANN) were used. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm\ufffd\ufffd\\"II (NSGAII) was applied to the constructed ANNs to obtain optimal results. The results were presented in the form of Pareto frontiers to help designers choose optimized configurations based on their manufacturing limitations. Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to, cost (related to the number of layers), laminate architecture (fiber orientation and stacking sequence) which can be constrained by the manufacturing techniques (i.e. filament winding) and thickness (as an example of physical constraints).\",","1403":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1404":"\"description-provenance\": [","1405":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-08T09:00:39Z (GMT).

The concurrence of computation resources and a large volume of data has boosted researchers' desire for developing feasible Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for large parameter spaces. Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMMs) have become a Bayesian mainstay for modeling heterogeneous structures, namely clusters, especially when the quantity of clusters is not known with the established MCMC methods. As opposed to many ad-hoc clustering methods, using Dirichlet Processes (DPs) in models provide a flexible and probabilistic approach for automatically estimating both cluster structure and quantity. While DPs are not fully parameterized, they depend on both a base measure and a concentration parameter that can heavily impact inferences.   Determining the concentration parameter is critical and essential, since it adjusts the a-priori cluster expectation, but typical approaches for specifying this parameter are rather cavalier. In this work, we propose a new method for automatically and adaptively determining this parameter, which directly calibrates distances between clusters through an explicit link function within the DP. Furthermore, we extend our method to mixture models with Nested Dirichlet Processes (NDPs) that cluster the multilevel data and depend on the specification of a vector of concentration parameters. In this work, we detail how to incorporate our method in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, and illustrate our findings through a series of comparative simulation studies and applications.\",","1448":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1449":"\"description-provenance\": [","1450":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-09T09:00:29Z (GMT).

However, there are still some drawbacks hindering its wide application, such as high operative temperature, electrode degradation, chromium poisoning, oxidization of interconnect, and so on.   Cathode plays a major role in determining the electrochemical performance of a single cell. In this dissertation, three perovskite cathode materials, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF), Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (BSCF), and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (SSCF), are comparatively studied through half-cells in the temperature range of 600-800 \u00baC. Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) block layer on the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte can lead to smaller polarization resistances of the three cathode materials through stopping the reaction between the cathodes and the YSZ electrolyte. SDC is also used as a catalyst to increase the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate in the LSCF cathode.   In addition, interconnect is protected by CoxFe1-x oxide and Co3O4/SDC/Co3O4 tri-layer coatings separately. These coatings are demonstrated to be effective in decreasing the area specific resistance (ASR) of the interconnect, inhibiting the Cr diffusion/evaporation, leading higher electrochemical performance of the SSCF-based half-cell. Only 1.54 at% of Cr is detected on the surface of the SSCF cathode with the Co0.8Fe0.2 oxide coated interconnect and no Cr is detected with the Co3O4/SDC/Co3O4 tri-layer coated interconnect.   Finally, single cells with LSCF, BSCF, and SSCF as the cathodes are operated in the temperature range of 600-800 \u00b0C fueled by natural gas. BSCF has the highest power density of 39 mW cm-2 at 600 \u00b0C, 88 mW cm-2 at 650 \u00b0C, and 168 mW cm-2 at 700 \u00b0C; LSCF has the highest power density of 263 mW cm-2 at 750 \u00b0C and 456 mW cm-2 at 800 \u00b0C. Activation energies calculated from the cathode ASR are 0.44 eV, 0.38 eV, and 0.52 eV for the LSCF, BSCF, and SSCF cathodes respectively, which means the BSCF cathode is preferred. The stability test shows that the BSCF-based single cell is more stable at lower operative temperature (600 \u00b0C) while the LSCF-based single cell is more stable at higher operative temperature (800 \u00b0C).\",","1491":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1492":"\"description-provenance\": [","1493":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-09T09:00:51Z (GMT).

It was first used in 1852 by William Henry Fox Talbot to settle a dispute with reference to the synchronous position of a horse's hooves while galloping.  Since that time private industry, government, and enthusiasts have been measuring dynamic scenarios with high speed video.  One challenge that faces the high speed video community is the dynamic range of the sensors.  The dynamic range of the sensor is constrained to the bit depth of the analog to digital converter, the deep well capacity of the sensor site, and baseline noise.  A typical high speed camera can span a 60 dB dynamic range, 1000:1, natively.  More recently the dynamic range has been extended to about 80 dB utilizing different pixel acquisition methods. \tIn this dissertation a method to extend the dynamic range will be presented and demonstrated to extend the dynamic range of a high speed camera system to over 170 dB, about 31,000,000:1.  The proposed formation methodology is adaptable to any camera combination, and almost any needed dynamic range.  The dramatic increase in the dynamic range is made possible through an adaptation of the current high dynamic range image formation methodologies.  Due to the high cost of a high speed camera, a minimum number of cameras are desired to form a high dynamic range high speed video system.  With a reduced number of cameras spanning a significant range, the errors on the formation process compound significantly relative to a normal high dynamic range image.  The increase in uncertainty is created from the lack of relevant correlated information for final image formation, necessitating the development of a new formation methodology. \tIn the proceeding text the problem statement and background information will be reviewed in depth.  The development of a new weighting function, stochastic image formation process, tone map methodology, and optimized multi camera design will be presented.  The proposed methodologies' effectiveness will be compared to current methods throughout the text and a final demonstration will be presented.\",","1586":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1587":"\"description-provenance\": [","1588":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-10T09:00:25Z (GMT).

This leguminous crop is frequently contaminated with aflatoxins, which are secondary metabolites of some Aspergillus fungi, mostly Aspergillus. flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins in foods are known to cause liver cancer, stunted growth in children, immune system disorders and economic losses. Aflatoxin contamination of peanuts during storage is worse in the tropics because climatic storage conditions there are almost the same as the optimum conditions for Aspergillus growthtemperature conditions of about 26-43 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 62-99%. This study investigated the growth of Aspergillus and the production of aflatoxin in shelled peanuts under varying treatment and packaging conditions. In addition, the appropriate pre-storage treatments and packaging needed to reduce aflatoxin production and to maintain quality of shelled and in-shell peanuts in storage under tropical environments were studied. Another aim was to determine the impact of the switch to hermetic storage on peanut farming and marketing profitability in Ghana.  Different peanut treatments, with and without Aspergillus flavus fungi, were packaged in different systems; specifically, polypropylene woven sacks and hermetic packaging. Peanuts were analyzed for fungi growth, aflatoxin production and lipid oxidation (peroxide value and p-Anisidine value).  Partial roasting and blanching of peanuts eliminated aflatoxigenic fungi and halted aflatoxin production in stored peanuts, increased the effectiveness of peanut sorting and, hence, helped reduce or eliminate aflatoxin levels along the peanut value chain. Additionally, the results of this study demonstrated that hermetic storage, by suppressing aflatoxin production, has the potential for maintaining peanut quality vis a vis polypropylene woven packaging. Profitability analysis conducted as part of this study revealed that the use of the hermetic storage system would not only improve farmer and trader profits, but also reduce the incidence of various ailments attributed to aflatoxins.\",","1632":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1633":"\"description-provenance\": [","1634":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-14T09:00:16Z (GMT).

Based on the proposed approach, a portable cost-effective stationary system is developed to capture 3D shapes in the order of micrometer scale. The PS with SNI technique is adopted to reconstruct 3D microtopology since this technique is highlighted for its capability to reproduce fine surface details at pixel resolution. Furthermore, since the primary hardware components are merely a camera and several typical LEDs, the system based on PS with SNI can be made portable at low cost. \t\t\t The principal contributions are three folds. First, a PS method based on dichromatic reflectance model (DRM) using color input images is proposed to generalize PS applicable to a wider range of surfaces with non-Lambertian reflectances. The proposed method not only estimates surface orientations from diffuse reflection but also exploits information from specularities owing to the proposed diffuse-specular separation algorithm. Using the proposed PS method, material-dependent features can be simultaneously extracted in addition to surface orientations, which offers much richer information in understanding the 3D scene and poses more potential functionalities, such as specular removal, intrinsic image decomposition, digital relighting, material-based segmentation, material transfer and material classification. \t\t\t The second contribution is the development of an SNI method dealing with perspective distortion. The proposed SNI is performed on the image plane instead of on the target surface as did by orthographic SNI owing to the newly derived representation of surface normals. The motivation behind the representation is from the observation that spatially uniform image points are simpler for integration than the non-uniform distribution of surface points under perspective projection. The new representation is then manipulated to the so-called log gradient space in analogy to the gradient space in orthographic SNI. With this analogy, the proposed method can inherit most past algorithms developed for orthographic SNI. By applying the proposed SNI, perspective distortion can be efficiently tackled with for smooth surfaces. In addition, the method is PS-independent, which can keep the image irradiance equation in a simple form during PS. \t\t\t The third contribution is the design and calibration of a 3D micro-scale shape reconstruction system using the derived PS and SNI methods. This system is originally designed for on-site measurement of pavement microtexture, while its applicability can be generalized to a wider range of surfaces. Optimal illumination was investigated in theory and through numerical simulations. Five different calibrations regarding various aspects of the system were either newly proposed or modified from existing methods. The performances of these calibrations were individually evaluated.

Since many tweets talk about events (with useful location information), such as natural disasters, emergencies, and accidents, it is important to geo-locate those tweets whenever possible.    Due to possible location ambiguity, finding a tweet's location often is challenging. Many distinct places have the same geoname, e.g., \\"Greenville\\" matches 50 different locations in the U.S.A. Frequently, in tweets, explicit location information, like geonames mentioned, is insufficient, because tweets are often brief and incomplete. They have a small fraction of the full location information of an event due to the 140 character limitation. Location indicative words (LIWs) may include latent location information, for example, \\"Water main break near White House\\" does not have any geonames but it is related to a location \\"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500 USA\\" indicated by the key phrase 'White House'.     To disambiguate tweet locations, we first extracted geospatial named entities (geonames) and predicted implicit state (e.g., Virginia or California) information from entities using machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF). Implicit state information helps reduce ambiguity. We also studied how location information of events is expressed in tweets and how latent location indicative information can help to geo-locate tweets. We then used a machine learning (ML) approach to predict the implicit state using geonames and LIWs.    We conducted experiments with tweets (e.g., about potholes), and found significant improvement in disambiguating tweet locations using a ML algorithm along with the Stanford NER. Adding state information predicted by our classifiers increased the possibility to find the state-level geo-location unambiguously by up to 80%. We also studied over 6 million tweets (3 mid-size and 2 big-size collections about water main breaks, sinkholes, potholes, car crashes, and car accidents), covering 17 months. We found that up to 91.1% of tweets have at least one type of location information (geo-coordinates or geonames), or LIWs. We also demonstrated that in most cases adding LIWs helps geo-locate tweets with less ambiguity using a geo-coding API. Finally, we conducted additional experiments with the five different tweet collections, and found significant improvement in disambiguating tweet locations using a ML approach with geonames and all LIWs that are present in tweet texts as features.\",","1724":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1725":"\"description-provenance\": [","1726":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-14T09:00:35Z (GMT).

The conceptual multi-source interior CT scheme has provided a potential solution to reduce motion artifacts and radiation exposure. This dissertation work conducted multi-facet investigations on a novel multi-source interior CT architecture (G. Cao, et. al, IEEE Access, 2014;2:1263-71) which employs distributed stationary multi-beam Carbon-nanotube (CNT) X-ray sources and simultaneously operates multiple source-detector chains to improve temporal resolution. The collimation based interior CT is integrated in each imaging chain, to suppress radiation dose. The central thesis statement isCompared to conventional CT design, this distributed source array based multi-source interior CT architecture shall provide ultra-fast CT scan of region-of-interest (ROI) inside body with comparable image quality at lower radiation dose. Comprehensive studies were conducted to separately investigate three critical aspects of multi-source interior CTinterior CT mode, X-ray scattering, and scatter correction methods. First, a single CNT X-ray source based interior micro-CT was constructed to serve as a down-scaled experimental verification platform for interior CT mode. Interior CT mode demonstrated comparable contrast-noise-ratio (CNR) and image structural similarity to the standard global CT mode, while inducing a significant radiation dose reduction (< 83.9%). Second, the data acquisition of multi-source interior CT was demonstrated at clinical geometry, via numerical simulation and physical experiments. The simultaneously operated source-detector chains induced significant X-ray forward / cross scattering and thus caused severe CNR reduction (< 68.5%) and CT number error (< 1122 HU). To address the scatter artifacts, a stationary beam-stopper-array (BSA) based and a source-trigger-sequence (STS) based scatter correction methods were proposed to enable the online scatter measurement / correction with further radiation dose reduction (< 50%). Moreover, a deterministic physics model was also developed to iteratively remove the scatter-artifacts in the multi-source interior CT, without the need for modifications in imaging hardware or protocols. The three proposed scatter correction methods improved CNR (< 94.0%) and suppressed CT number error (< 48 HU). With the dedicated scatter correction methods, the multi-source interior CT could provide ROI-oriented imaging with acceptable image quality at significantly reduced radiation dose.\",","1778":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1779":"\"description-provenance\": [","1780":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-17T09:00:17Z (GMT).

Current design methods predict the strength of thin-walled metallic structural members based on individual buckling limit-states and limited case of interactive buckling limit state. In order to develop design methods for most coupled buckling limit states, the interaction of buckling modes needs to be studied.   This dissertation first introduces a generally applicable methodology for Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) elastic buckling analysis on members with holes, where the buckling modes of gross cross-section interact with those of net cross-section. The approach treats member with holes as a structural system consisting of prismatic sub-members. These sub-members are connected by enforcing nodal compatibility conditions for the GBT discretization points at the interfaces. To represent the shear lag effect and nonlinear normal stress distribution in the vicinity of a hole, GBT shear modes with nonlinear warping are included. Modifications are made to the GBT geometric stiffness because of the influence from shear lag effect caused by holes. In the following sections, the GBT formulation for a prismatic bar is reviewed and the GBT formulation for members with holes is introduced. Special aspects of analyzing members with holes are defined, namely the compatibility conditions to connect sub-members and the geometric stiffness for members with holes. Validation and three examples are provided.   The second topic of this dissertation involves a buckling mode decomposition method of normalized displacement field, bending stresses and strain energy for thin-walled member displacement field (point clouds or finite element results) based on generalized beam theory (GBT). The method provides quantitative modal participation information regarding eigen-buckling displacement fields, stress components and elastic strain energy, that can be used to inform future design approaches. In the method, GBT modal amplitudes are retrieved at discrete cross-sections, and the modal amplitude field is reconstructed assuming it can be piece-wisely approximated by polynomials. The unit displacement field, stress components and strain energy are all retrieved by using reconstructed GBT modal amplitude field and GBT constitutive laws. Theory and examples are provided, and potential applications are discussed including cold-formed steel member design and post-disaster evaluation of thin-walled structural members.  In the third part, post-buckling modal decomposition is made possible by development of a geometrically nonlinear GBT software. This tool can be used to assist understanding couple-buckling limit-states. Lastly, the load-deformation response considering any one GBT mode is derived analytically for fast computation and interpretation of structural post-buckling behavior.\",","1824":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1825":"\"description-provenance\": [","1826":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-17T09:00:28Z (GMT).

This strategic information is vital in load forecasting, demand-side management planning and long-term resource and capital planning.  With the proliferation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in recent years, the amount of load profile data collected by utilities has grown exponentially. Such high-resolution datasets are difficult to model and analyze due to the large size, diverse usage patterns, and the embedded noisy or erroneous data points. In order to overcome these challenges and to make the load data useful in system analysis, this dissertation introduces a frequency domain load profile modeling framework. This framework can be used a complementary technology alongside of the conventional time domain load profile modeling techniques.   There are three main components in this framework1) the frequency domain load profile descriptor, which is a compact, modular and extendable representation of the original load profile. A methodology was introduced to demonstrate the construction of the frequency domain load profile descriptor. 2) The load profile Characteristic Attributes in the Frequency Domain (CAFD). Which is developed for load profile characterization and classification. 3) The frequency domain load profile statistics and forecasting models. Two different models were introduced in this dissertationthe first one is the wavelet load forecast model and the other one is a stochastic model that incorporates local weather condition and frequency domain load profile statistics to perform medium term load profile forecast.   7 different utilities load profile data were used in this research to demonstrate the viability of modeling load in the frequency domain. The data comes from various customer classes and geographical regions.

The first chapter summarizes the three topics and briefly describes the motivation, methods applied and main conclusions in each study.   Chapter 2 presents a meta-analysis of hedonic property value studies on the value of tree cover. A meta-regression was performed using implicit value estimates for tree cover at property-level from various locations in the U.S. along with auxiliary data of county-level tree cover to investigate the relationship between tree cover and implicit-price estimates for residential properties. The study found that on average 35 percent and 40 percent tree cover respectively at property-level and county-level optimize the benefits to the property owners in urban areas. These results provide insights to forward-looking communities to adapt their tree planting and protection efforts to lessen climate-induced impacts.  Chapter 3 applies a first-stage Hedonic property price model to estimate preference for tree cover in urban communities using single-family house sales data from multiple property markets across the U.S. The study analyses how home owners' preference for tree cover vary across the landscape and across cities. Further, it identifies what factors affect these variations via the general inferences obtained from an internal meta-analysis. The study confirms the heterogeneity of preferences as affected by the differences in the abundance of tree cover in study locations, regional differences and household characteristics. These findings add to the hedonic literature and provide useful information for future urban planning.    Chapter 4 focuses on cooperative management of invasive species in landscapes with mixed land ownerships. This study analyzes the effect of the land ownership on the management efforts between an infested municipality and an uninfested municipality when a transferable payment scheme is involved in the cooperative agreement. A dynamic optimization problem was set up to evaluate the case of Emerald ash borer (EAB) control in multiple jurisdictions in the Twin Cities, Minnesota. The results suggest that when the infested municipality has more public lands and when the transfer payments are efficiently used to implement greater control, the municipalities are more likely to commit to bargaining, and smaller transfer payments paid over a longer span of time are sufficient for optimal control of the spread of invasive species across the municipalities.    The last chapter concludes the three studies and discusses the insights for future research.\",","1923":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1924":"\"description-provenance\": [","1925":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-22T09:00:13Z (GMT).

However, in previous literature, we find inconsistent findings regarding the drivers and outcomes of a firm's leverage of alliance partners' technological knowledge. In this dissertation, I consider opposite propositions in prior studies simultaneously and examine two research questions1) what motivates a firm to search technological knowledge from alliance partners? And 2) how configurations of alliance knowledge and alliance network affect firm innovation?  I argue that alliance knowledge search motivation is determined by the allocation of managerial attention to local domains and distant domains. While distant attention motives alliance knowledge search, local attention suppresses the motivation.  I hypothesize that innovation performance below the aspiration level intensifies both local and distant attentions and has an inverted U-shaped relationship with alliance knowledge search intensity. This curvilinear relationship is moderated by the focal firm's knowledge stock size since firms with large knowledge stock are more likely to develop distant attention in the presence of poor innovation performance.  I further argue that exploration and exploitation play key roles in the configurations of both alliance knowledge and alliance network. Alliance knowledge leveraging can contribute more to firm innovation, if the firm can establish a balance between exploration and exploitation. I propose that balancing exploration and exploitation within a single domain (e.g., search moderately explorative alliance knowledge) generates great managerial costs. However, firms can balance exploration and exploitation across domainsthey can leverage explorative knowledge through exploitative alliances, such as repeated partnerships and strong ties.  I test related hypotheses using longitudinal data from the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry. Results show that1) innovation performance below the aspiration level has an inverted U-shaped relationship with alliance knowledge search, demonstrating that both distant and local attention play important roles in developing the motivation for alliance knowledge search; 2) increasing knowledge stock size increases both positive and negative effects of innovation performance below aspiration; 3) technological distance of searched alliance knowledge has a linear negative effect on firm innovation; and 4) leveraging explorative knowledge from repeated partnership, but not strong ties, leads to superior innovation performance, supporting the idea of establishing the balance across domains. The findings make important contributions to alliance knowledge leveraging, aspiration, and exploration-exploitation literatures. The managerial implications of the study are also discussed.\",","1967":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","1968":"\"description-provenance\": [","1969":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-23T09:00:12Z (GMT).

Although antibody response plays a role in immune defense against S. aureus, cellular responses are of interest for vaccine development. A vaccine that stimulates both antibody and cellular responses could promote memory cell formation and provide effective protection against S. aureus. The superantigens and virulence factors secreted by live S. aureus (LSA) can interfere with immune responses and memory cell formation. Because irradiation reduces the metabolic activity and secretion of proteins, including S. aureus superantigens and hemolysins, we hypothesized the irradiated S. aureus (ISA) could drive immune cell responses.  Dendritic cells (DC) were co-cultured with lymphocytes to study the cellular responses to ISA and LSA. Dendritic cells present antigens and polarize lymphocytes into different helper T (Th) cell types that drive cellular immune responses. The DC loaded with either ISA or LSA induced increased mRNA transcription of Th17-related cytokines and cytotoxic effector memory cell formation during antigen recall experiments. Lymphocytes co-cultured with LSA-loaded DC exhibited a higher fold-change in interferon (IFN)  \u03b3 mRNA compared to ISA-loaded DC, suggesting the secreted antigens and the metabolic activity of S. aureus play a role in Th1 polarization.   Th1 polarization can drive excessive inflammation and suppress beneficial Th17 responses. Bovine DC were stimulated with a mutant \u03b1-toxin deletion S. aureus strain to evaluate if \u03b1-toxin-mediated NOD2 receptor signaling activates Th1 polarization in response to S. aureus, which revealed that NOD2 mRNA transcription in DC was independent of \u03b1-toxin and that the deletion of \u03b1-toxin had no effect on the transcription of the cytokine IL-12 or the production of IFN\u03b3 by lymphocytes, events that drive Th1 polarization, in co-cultures. The deletion of accessory gene regulator (agr), which controls \u03b1-toxin production, reduced IFN\u03b3 production in lymphocytes co-cultured with the S. aureus-loaded DC, indicating that agr controlled the ability of S. aureus antigens to drive the Th1 polarization of lymphocytes.   Overall, this thesis demonstrates that ISA is a promising source of antigens that stimulate memory cells formation and Th17 polarization in bovine immune cells. The reduced Th1 cytokine response to S. aureus was not dependent on \u03b1-toxin, but other virulence factors controlled by agr should be screened to determine the source of Th1 stimulation.\",","2010":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2011":"\"description-provenance\": [","2012":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-25T09:00:15Z (GMT).

However, realizing this potential depends on full accounting of the ecosystem carbon (C) budget. The separate evaluation of root-derived, autotrophic (RA) and microbially-derived heterotrophic (RH) soil respiration in response to management and climate change is important, as environmental and ecological factors often differentially affect these components, and RH can be weighed against net primary productivity (NPP) to estimate the C sink or source status of forest ecosystems. The objective of this research was to improve the quantitative and mechanistic understanding of soil respiratory fluxes in managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations of the southeastern U.S. To achieve this overall objective, three studies were implemented to1) estimate the proportion and seasonality of RH:RS in four stand age classes, and identify relationships between RH:RS and stand characteristics 2) evaluate the effects of forest nutrient management and throughfall reduction on factors that influence RH and decomposition dynamics, including litter quality, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity and 3) evaluate the sensitivity of sources of RH (mineral soil-derived heterotrophic respiration; RHM, and leaf litter-derived heterotrophic respiration; RHL) to varying soil and litter water content over the course of a dry down event, and assess whether fertilization influences RH. Stand age and measurement season each had a significant effect on RH:RS (P < 0.001), but there were no interactive effects (P = 0.202). Mean RH:RS during the 12-month study declined with stand age, and were 0.82, 0.73, 0.59, and 0.50 for 3-year-old, 9-year-old, 18- year-old, and 25-year-old stands, respectively. Across all age classes, the winter season had the highest mean RH:RS of 0.85 while summer had the lowest of 0.55. Additionally, there were highly significant (P < 0.001) and strong (r > 0.5) correlations between RH:RS and peak LAI, stem volume, and understory biomass. Fertilization improved litter quality by significantly decreasing lignin:N and lignin:P ratios, caused a shift in extracellular enzyme activity from mineral soil N- and P-acquiring enzyme activity to litter C-acquiring enzyme activity, and increased microbial biomass pools. Throughfall reduction decreased litter quality by increasing lignin:N and lignin:P, but also increased C-acquiring enzyme activity. RHL was more sensitive to water content than RHM, and increased linearly with increasing litter water content (R2 = 0.89). The contribution of RHL to RH was greatest immediately following the wetting event, and decreased rapidly to near-zero between three \ufffd\\" 10 days. RHM also had a strong relationship with soil water content (R2 = 0.62), but took between 200 \ufffd\\" 233 days to attain near-zero RHM rates. Fertilization had no effect on RHM (P = 0.657), but significantly suppressed RHL rates after the wetting event (P < 0.009). This research provides estimates of RH:RS in managed loblolly pine systems that can be used to improve regional ecosystem C modeling efforts, and demonstrates the need to consider the impact of stand age and seasonal patterns to identify the point at which plantations switch from functioning as C sources to C sinks. Additionally, it demonstrates that the controls over RH are dynamic and influenced in the short-term by fertilization and changed precipitation regimes, with the greatest impact on properties affecting litter RH compared to mineral soil. Future research should work to improve the mechanistic understanding of the seasonal and spatial variability of RH and related controlling biotic and abiotic parameters to remedy the variability in existing RS and ecosystem C models.  Understanding how management and climate change may impact factors that control RH will ultimately improve our understanding of what drives changes in forest C fluxes.\",","2057":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2058":"\"description-provenance\": [","2059":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-25T09:00:24Z (GMT).

The purpose of the study was to investigate an exemplary case of self-determined technology enthusiasts in the hopes of generating a substantive grounded theory that conceptualizes their experiences and concerns. Twelve unstructured interviews of amateur radio enthusiasts from the eastern United States provided the initial / primary data for this study. Experimenting and self-teaching in technological activities was highlighted as the main concern of the participants. The basic social process (BSP) of technological immersion learning (TIL) emerged as a theoretical construct and core variable that illuminates the experiences of individuals immersed in a community of practice, where hands-on engagement with technology is a primary activity. Adventuring, Affirmation, Doing Technology, Experimenting, Overcoming Challenge, Self-teaching, and Social Networking were properties of technological immersion learning that interact dialectically in an amplifying causal loop, with Problem solving and Designing as active sub processes in response to unmet challenges. TIL occurs cyclically in three stages, beginning with Induction, a credentialing stage wherein the neophyte is prepared with the necessary knowledge and skill to become a novice participant in an activity. The transition from Induction into the Immersion phase is a status passage whereby the novice is absorbed into the technical culture of the group and commences autonomous active participation in hands-on experimenting. Hands-on experiences with experimenting, problem solving and social interactions provide diverse learning and affirmation for the doer and multiple sources of feedback that promote sustained engagement. The transition into the Maturation phase proceeds gradually over time, with prolonged engagement and cumulative gains in knowledge, skill, and experience. Maturation is a quasi-stable state that remains responsive to new contexts as a random-walk process, wherein trigger events can initiate new cycles of technological immersion learning in a perpetually evolving process of personal development. Engagement, Empowerment, and Self-Actualization are underlying dimensions of the TIL basic social process that provide the impetus for continued persistence and personal development.\",","2102":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2103":"\"description-provenance\": [","2104":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-25T09:00:31Z (GMT).

Although these systems are complex, they are ubiquitous in the Internet of Things (IoT) era of autonomous vehicles/drones, smart homes, smart grids, etc. where everything is connected. These systems are vulnerable to unauthorized penetration due to the absence of proper security features and safeguards to protect important information. Examples such as the  typewriter hack involving subversive chips resulting in leakage of keystroke data and hardware backdoors crippling anti-aircraft guns during an attack demonstrate the need to protect all system functions. With more focus on securing a system, trust in untrusted components at the integration stage is of a higher priority.  This work builds on a red-black security system, where an architecture testbed is developed with critical and non-critical IP cores and subjected to a variety of Hardware Trojan Threats (HTTs). These attacks defeat the classic trusted hardware model assumptions and demonstrate the ability of Trojans to evade detection methods based on physical characteristics. A novel metric is defined for hardware Trojan detection, termed as HTT Detectability Metric (HDM) that leverages a weighted combination of normalized physical parameters. Security analysis results show that using HDM, 86% of the implemented Trojans were detected as compared to using power consumption, timing variation and resource utilization alone. This led to the formulation of the security requirements for the development of a novel, distributed and secure methodology for enhancing trust in systems developed under untrusted environments called FIDelity Enhancing Security (FIDES). FIDES employs a decentralized information flow control (DIFC) model that enables safe and distributed information flows between various elements of the system such as IP cores, physical memory and registers. The DIFC approach annotates/tags each data item with its sensitivity level and the identity of the participating entities during the communication.    Trust enhanced FIDES (TE-FIDES) is proposed to address the vulnerabilities arising from the declassification process during communication between third-party soft IP cores. TE-FIDES employs a secure enclave approach for preserving the confidentiality of the sensitive information in the system. TE-FIDES is evaluated by targeting an IoT-based smart grid CPS application, where malicious third-party soft IP cores are prevented from causing a system blackout. The resulting hardware implementation using TE-FIDES is found to be resilient to multiple hardware Trojan attacks.\",","2148":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2149":"\"description-provenance\": [","2150":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-02T09:00:15Z (GMT).

Prior research has shown that hybrid learning systems more effectively improve student learning than do either traditional or cyberlearning approaches used individually. The Online Watershed Learning System (OWLS) is an interactive cyberlearning system for use in hybrid education. It serves as the end user interface of the Learning Enhanced Watershed Assessment System (LEWAS), a watershed monitoring system for use in research and education. The LEWAS/OWLS has been integrated into 26 courses. Within the theoretical framework of situated learning, the OWLS uses data and imagery to situate users at the LEWAS site. The current research has the dual goals of developing the OWLS and evaluating its effectiveness within a hybrid learning environment as part of watershed monitoring education. Within goal 1, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript code (11,112 lines) were used to achieve platform independence, and student and faculty feedback suggests a hierarchy of cyberlearning interface features, where anywhere/anytime access is the most important class of features for these users followed by real-time data visualization, system background information and how-to-use information in descending order. For students at the community college freshmen, university senior and graduate levels, goal 2 investigated how much the OWLS increases student learning of environmental monitoring topics and motivates them to study these topics. For this goal, use of the LEWAS/OWLS increased learning and motivation for most students with the caveats that the these gains were not always statistically significant and that these gains may be caused by use of the LEWAS in general rather than by the OWLS component of it. Additional studies are needed to resolve these issues. Additionally, a pilot test of anonymous user tracking (11,231 page views) showed how it can be used to obtain general information about which groups of users are accessing a cyberlearning system, how they are accessing it, and how navigation through the system can be improved to better match user goals.

Upgrading of potable water systems represents a large financial burden for water utilities and private property owners. The conventional approaches of repair, rehabilitation and replacement are very effective, but will take decades to implement even if a financial commitment to do so was made immediately. A novel approach of in-situ remediation of leaks, achieved by harnessing the ability of water or pipe to repair leaks via clogging, could potentially reduce leak rates and extend the lifetime of existing infrastructure at relatively low cost and inconvenience.     Physical clogging, precipitation and metallic corrosion were identified as major mechanisms of in-situ leak remediation in potable water pipelines. Autogenous repair (i.e., self-repair without added particles) of small leak-holes (150\u2013\\"1000 \u03bcm) in copper and iron was validated in the laboratory at water pHs of 3.0\u201311.0, operating water pressures of 20\u201360 psi, upward and downward leak orientations, and for a range of water chemistries.     In bench scale experiments, the time to repair of iron pipe leaks increased with leak size to the power of 0.89\u20131.89, and decreased with pipe wall thickness to the power of -1.9 to -1.0. The time to repair of copper pipe leaks increased with water pressure to the power of 1.7. Additionally, the waters with a higher DO and corrosivity as measured by RSI, significantly decreased the time to repair of carbon steel 400 \u03bcm leaks by 50\u201370%. The presence of chlorine dioxide significantly increased the fraction of repaired 200 \u03bcm copper pipe leaks by 3 times when compared to the control without any disinfectant. In the building scale study, the fraction of repaired iron pipe leaks decreased with the logarithmic leak size with a slope of -0.65 after one-year duration of experiments, while leak orientation and water pressure were not influential in time to or likelihood of repair for iron pipe leaks.     Addition of calcium carbonate particles (~8.8 \u03bc]m), silica particles (~29 \u03bcm) and wood ash particles (~160 \u03bcm) in Blacksburg, VA tap water at a water pressure of 10 psi increased the fraction of remediated iron pipe leaks of 280\u20131000 \u03bcm diameter sizes. Although the control condition with no added particles for 58 days resulted in remediation of 0/12 leaks, remediation rate increased to 1/12 with calcium carbonate particles, to 10/12 with silica particles and to 10/12 with wood ash particles. Leak size and particle size played an important role in controlling the remediation success rate.    The strength of the in-situ leak repair was sometimes very strong and resilient. The sealing materials of leak-holes repaired at 20\u201360 psi could sometimes withstand a 100 psi water pressure without failure, demonstrating the potential of the approach to sustain aging and leaking infrastructure. In-situ leak repair can also occur naturally, and the success rate might be unintentionally altered by adjustment of chemistry or treatments that decrease or increase particulates.\",","2241":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2242":"\"description-provenance\": [","2243":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-03T09:00:19Z (GMT).

Under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, a firm making the PRE assertion is able to avoid recognizing residual U.S. taxes on earnings of its foreign subsidiaries so long as it reinvests those earnings outside of the U.S.  Suboptimal reinvestment is a potential consequence for PRE-asserting firms due to limited reinvestment opportunities abroad.   Suboptimal foreign reinvestment, typically high amounts of reinvestment in financial assets, may be viewed negatively by financial statement users, particularly those users concerned with the default risk of a firm.      The disclosure of PRE-related information varies substantially and the actual degree of compliance with this accounting standard has been questioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  While firms may believe it is advantageous to obscure their PRE-related activity due to media or political concerns, recent academic literature has highlighted a negative relation between disclosure quality in financial statements and credit risk.      The purpose of this study is to examine the relations among foreign reinvestment strategy, PRE disclosure, and long-term credit ratings.  First, I examine the direct effect of a firm's reinvestment strategy on its long-term credit rating.  Second, I investigate the relation between a firm's reinvestment strategy and its choice to disclose PRE-related information.  Third, I study the relation between a firm's choice to disclose PRE-related information and its long-term credit rating.   Finally, I examine the potential attenuating effect of the PRE disclosure on the negative relation between financial reinvestment and credit ratings.  Using hand collected PRE data for Fortune 500 firms from 1997-2010, I find a negative relation between the intensity of a firm's reinvestment in financial assets and its (1) long-term credit rating and (2) choice to disclose PRE-related information.  Furthermore, I find a positive relation between a firm's choice to disclose PRE and its credit rating.\",","2287":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2288":"\"description-provenance\": [","2289":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-14T08:00:16Z (GMT).

This dissertation anticipates some of the complexities in balancing stakeholder goals and developing building standards to limit OP growth, and advances scientific understanding of OP survival and proliferation in domestic plumbing systems.     In a cross-sectional survey of water- and energy-efficient buildings, domestic water age ranged from 8 days to 6 months and resulted in pH and temperature fluctuations, rapid disinfectant residual decay up to 144 times faster than municipal water delivered to the buildings, and elevated levels of OP gene markers. This motivates future work to determine how to maintain high quality and safe water while preserving the sustainability goals of these cutting-edge buildings.    Head-to-head pilot-scale experiments examining OP growth in recirculating hot water systems revealed that elevated temperature had an overarching inhibitory effect on L. pneumophila growth where temperatures were maintained. However, control was undermined in distal branches, especially when density-driven convective mixing gradients maintained ideal growth temperatures and delivered nutrients to the otherwise stagnant branches. These results resolve discrepancies reported in the literature regarding the effects of flow, and identify important system design and operational conditions that facilitate OP growth.     Advancements were also made in understanding how corrosion can trigger OP growth. In Flint, MI, corrosive Flint River water damaged iron pipes, releasing iron nutrients, consuming chlorine residual, and supporting high levels of L. pneumophila in large building systems. This likely triggered two unprecedented clusters of Legionnaire's disease.     In pilot-scale systems, copper released from copper pipes, but not dosed as soluble cupric, triggered release of >1,100 times more H2 into the water due to deposition corrosion. The organic carbon fixed by autotrophic hydrogen oxidation has the potential to facilitate OP growth, but more work is needed to understand the limits of this mechanism.     Finally, well-controlled laboratory experiments confirmed past reports from field surveys that the use of chloramines trigger a trade-off between controlling Legionella and allowing non-tuberculous Mycobacteria to persist.\",","2332":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2333":"\"description-provenance\": [","2334":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-16T05:07:44Z (GMT).

For example, when monitoring 30-day mortality rates after surgery, the pre-operative risk of patients based on health characteristics is often an indicator of how likely the surgery is to succeed. In these cases, risk-adjusted monitoring techniques are used. In this work, the practical limitations of the traditional implementation of risk-adjusted monitoring methods are discussed and an improved implementation is proposed. A method to perform spatial risk-adjustment based on exact locations of concurrent observations to account for spatial dependence is also described. Furthermore, the development of objective priors for fully Bayesian hierarchical models for areal data is explored for Gaussian responses. Collectively, these statistical methods serve as analytic tools to better monitor and model spatial processes.\",","2381":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2382":"\"description-provenance\": [","2383":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-18T08:00:14Z (GMT).

Such projects often take years to come together and evolve with time through the actions of project sponsors and the engagement of various stakeholders. Stakeholders through engagement and input can help legitimize and improve large-scale project initiatives.  Stakeholders can also marshal opposition that can delay or block these projects.  Consequently, the significance of stakeholder involvement is critical in megaprojects.  Governments have increasingly utilized public-private partnerships (PPPs) for megaproject delivery.  This method introduces characteristics that distinguish PPP megaprojects from others such asprivate control, profiteering, foreign profits, and long-term concessions. This study investigates whether differences exist between PPP and non-PPP megaprojects with respect to stakeholder involvement strategies and stakeholder issues raised in such projects.  This research employed a longitudinal multiple case study approach that examined four tolled fixed crossing megaprojects; two of them were delivered as PPPs and two were delivered as design-build (i.e. non-PPP). The approach followed the design of prior studies in this area by De Schepper, Dooms, and Haezendonck (2014) and Winn (2001). Pre and post milestone event analysis captured trends and shifts in involvement strategies and stakeholder issues. Subsequently, stakeholder issue tables (organized by issue themes) and stakeholder mechanism tables (organized by mechanism type and information flow) were utilized for across case synthesis and comparison to identify similarities and differences.  Analysis of stakeholder involvements across cases showed that NEPA establishes a baseline for involvement, but its requirements are not sufficient for megaprojects; a more comprehensive strategy is necessary. Further, although participatory involvements may be beneficial particularly in complex settings, these mechanisms must be carefully managed in terms of process and criteria for evaluating stakeholder input. Additionally, when private partners/contractors are involved in megaprojects, they become part of the project team and support a coordinated involvement approach. Examination of stakeholder issues indicated that issues that are common to non-PPP and PPP projects are more prevalent than PPP specific issues. In particular, issues related to tolling are dominant; moreover, toll affordability is extremely sensitive, and its severity is predictable based on affected area demographics and past toll escalation practices. The study provided insights about how megaprojects are shaped through actions of project sponsors as well as impacted and interested stakeholders. It also demonstrated how these projects become artifacts of aspiration for politically powerful figures. Lastly, it identified the main stakeholder issues and suggested a set of guidelines to assist future practitioners in developing better stakeholder involvement strategies, which should both enhance and legitimize megaprojects.\",","2426":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2427":"\"description-provenance\": [","2428":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-21T08:00:12Z (GMT).

This decision support framework assists students in their design process in studio and studio-like educational environments. The purpose of this decision support framework is to influence the students in using vegetated assemblies in their future design inquiry. After implementation, the purpose was to determine the worth of the framework as a mechanism for knowledge sharing. Both purposes were reviewed in developing the framework using immersive case studies, classes both in traditional studios and studio-like courses, website development and member feedback.    The evidence of the resulting improvement of decision making or design work was found through the use of surveys, student reflective writing, and personal interpretation of student works and my own immersive design studies, classes, and development of the framework and its website. The surveys and reflective writing were collected from multiple years of involvement in traditional studio and studio-like classes to refine the framework and its use.     The results of the study suggest that students do have a larger body of knowledge to make decisions about utilizing vegetated assemblies than before the use of the framework and go on the continue using vegetated assemblies in design work. The framework presents the various factors that impact decisions into vegetated assemblies and develop future designs. By influencing and improving knowledge of such factors on the design of vegetated assemblies early in a student's education, improves decision making in future designs and later professional work.      Future work would be targeted at refining the framework and potential courses to include other topics of interest in relation to vegetated assemblies. Finally, the framework could be adapted into a more codified, interactive tool in the future.\",","2472":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2473":"\"description-provenance\": [","2474":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-28T08:00:20Z (GMT).

The analysis for this study involved computing descriptive statistics, correlating continuous variables, and running multiple regressions for each dataset (school and district for each year) to determine the predictors of the dependent variable, chronically absent teachers, defined as the percentage of teachers absent for more than 10 days. Although the school models were significant, neither was a particularly strong predictor of chronically absent teachers, only accounting for 15.2 percent variation (2011-2012 model with R2=.152) and 9.6 percent variation (2013-2014 model with R2=.096) that is predicted by the independent variables. Nevertheless, there were independent policy and school variables that were significant predictors in both school years.

Reports of forage and animal productivity from these systems indicate that, in some cases, animal gains are similar or better despite lower forage yield. The relationship between grazing system, body temperature, grazing behavior, and animal performance was explored in this study. Black walnut and honeylocust-based silvopasture systems were compared with open pastures in a randomized complete block design (r = 3) over three summers. Pastures were rotationally stocked with 5-7 lambs depending on forage availability. Lambs were weighed every four weeks. Behavior measures were recorded within a replicate within a week, and these measures were taken sequentially within three experimental periods. Ewe lambs (n = 3) were equipped with a vaginal temperature sensor (3 days) and an audio recording device (1 day) to detect prehension events. Cameras documented lamb behavior every 60 seconds. Forage measurements taken with a rising plate meter indicated greater productivity in the honeylocust silvopasture (5020 \u00b1 30 kg \u00b7 ha\u207b\u00b9 ) compared to the open pasture (4930 \u00b1 30 kg \u00b7 ha\u207b\u00b9 ; P = 0.0281), though forage availability in the black walnut silvopastures (3560 \u00b1 30 kg \u00b7 ha\u207b\u00b9 ) was lower than within the other treatments (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in animal gains between systems (P \u2265 0.4813), though gains were highest in the honeylocust silvopastures (25.6 \u00b1 3.4 kg \u00b7 period\u207b\u00b9 ), followed by the gains of the black walnut silvopastures (22.3 \u00b1 3.4 kg \u00b7 period\u207b\u00b9 ), and the gains of the open pastures (22.2 \u00b1 3.4 kg \u00b7 period- 1 ). Lambs in silvopastures spent more time lying down than animals in the open pastures (P \u2264 0.01), while lambs in the open spent more than two hours longer each day standing (P < 0.0001). During the hottest part of the day, ewes in the open pasture were 0.4 \u00b0C hotter than ewes in the black walnut silvopastures (P \u2264 0.0202). Lambs in the black walnut silvopastures grazed more (488 \u00b1 14 minutes \u00b7 day\u207b\u00b9 ) than lambs in the honeylocust silvopastures (438 \u00b1 15 minutes \u00b7 day\u207b\u00b9 ; P = 0.0192) and the open pastures (417 \u00b1 14 minutes \u00b7 day\u207b\u00b9 ; P = 0.0009), with no difference between the latter two systems (P = 0.3073). There was no difference in daily bites taken (P \u2265 0.7222), though lambs in the silvopastures grazed more frequently than lambs in the open pastures.   In one six week winter grazing study, animal performance in the honeylocust silvopastures was compared with the productivity of lambs grazing the open pastures and the black walnut silvopastures. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of these pods on lamb growth when animals grazed stockpiled tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus). Preand post-graze forage mass was estimated with a double sampling technique using a rising plate meter. Treatment pastures were rotationally stocked with three (walnut) or six lambs per experimental unit depending on forage availability. Fescue grab samples were collected every other rotation. Crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and total digestible nutrients (TDN) were estimated with a robust equation using NIR spectroscopy. Pre- and post-graze pod mass per hectare was estimated using randomly placed quadrats. Lambs were na\u00efve to pods and did not readily consume the fodder until four weeks into the trial, and the methods for estimating pod intake were not sufficient to detect pod differences in pre- and post-graze pod mass. Forage availability in the honeylocust silvopastures (5130 \u00b1 90 kg \u00b7 ha\u207b\u00b9 ) and open pastures (5050 \u00b1 90 kg \u00b7 ha\u207b\u00b9 ; P=0.7580) was greater (P < 0.0001) than forage availability in the black walnut silvopastures (3790 \u00b1 90 kg \u00b7 ha\u207b\u00b9 ). Treatment had no effect (P = 0.3763) on average daily gains across the six weeks of the study. However, lambs within the honeylocust silvopastures had greater (P = 0.0251) average daily gains in the final period (0.12 \u00b1 0.02 kg \u00b7 day\u207b\u00b9 ) than lambs within the open pastures (0 \u00b1 0.02 kg \u00b7 day\u207b\u00b9 ), and lambs were observed consuming the pods. These data suggest that honeylocust pods may support greater gains of lambs, but that previous exposure and longer study periods in pasture settings may be necessary to see their nutritional benefit when grazing high quality forages.\",","2565":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2566":"\"description-provenance\": [","2567":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-30T08:00:10Z (GMT).

This relationship attributes fluctuations in climate to the erosion of orogens, sedimentation rates, and geodynamics of the crust.  Glaciers are the most effective climate driven erosive processes, where the frequency of glacial periods has a direct impact on the structure of mountain ranges through time.  The late Cenozoic global cooling period was the beginning of a series of many glaciations which increased erosion in orogens experiencing fast rock uplift.  We characterize the threshold for the onset of effective glacial erosion and record the increase in erosion rate during the late Cenozoic in the Chugach and Kenai Mountains of Alaska.  We utilized low temperature thermochronometry and cosmogenic dating to constrain the spatial and temporal distribution of exhumation and glacial history in order to characterize the net effect of glaciers on an orogen that experiences slow rock uplift.  We constrain the spatial distribution of exhumation and characterize the landscape along the Kenai Peninsula, underlain by the transition from flat slab to normal subduction.  The region is characterized by old AHe ages which mimic the subduction angle of the down going plate and decrease away from an exhumational hotspot at a syntax in the Chugach Mountains.  We attribute the long term exhumational characteristic of the Kenai Peninsula to subduction and underplating of sediment shed from the accreting Yakutat microplate to the east.  A delineation of the glacial history using 10Be cosmogenic dating depict a series of glacial advances which date to the early and late Wisconsin.  We find that the asynchronuity of glaciation across maritime and continental Alaska is controlled by steep orographic precipitation gradients which result from upper plate deformation.  Finally, we observe an increase in erosion since the late Cenozoic using both AHe and cosmogenic dating and conclude that it is possible for the onset of effective glacial erosion in regions that experience slow to moderate rock uplift and that climate drives erosion rates in these regions.\",","2612":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2613":"\"description-provenance\": [","2614":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-30T08:00:18Z (GMT).

They use myriad techniques to this end, though not all students share in the success.  For example, Black male students are more likely to underperform than are other groups of students, which places their academic and economic survival at risk (Kirsch, Braun, Yamamoto, and Sum, 2007).  The focus of this study was on Black male student performance in Algebra 1.    Algebra 1 plays a pivotal role in academic success and is a leading indicator of a students likelihood of success in advanced mathematics courses (Wang and Goldschmidt, 2003).  Failure to learn and understand the content in Algebra 1 results in limitations on further mathematical opportunities in the short-term, which, in turn, reduces prospects for continued education beyond secondary school.     The purpose of this study was to examine and identify specific school leadership practices that influence and improve the Algebra 1 performance of Black male students.  Interviews with principals, lead math teachers, and school counselors provided qualitative data related to school-level leadership practices.  Additionally, I conducted document reviews of school newsletters, parent letters, robocall messages, lesson plans, and websites.  Analyses of the interviews and documents revealed six themes(a) effective instructional leadership, (b) culture of collaboration, (c) facilitation and scheduling, (d) parental involvement, (e) intervention and remediation, and (f) resources.

Gifted students are a natural resource of future innovators for these fields; however gifted programs are largely overlooked for program support. Since 1973, the Virginia Department of Education has sponsored a unique model of regional magnet programs for gifted and talented students called the Virginia Governor's Schools. These schools provide accelerated and differentiated curricula, often in the STEM subjects. As evaluation is a strong component to achieve more funding to meet the scientific and technological demands of these programs, the researcher explored the evaluation reports of five STEM-focused Virginia Governor's Schools. The purpose of the study was to collect consequential evidence of an untested rubric instrument used for the evaluations. A descriptive analysis of the instrument's criteria ratings, a content analysis of evaluation reports, and a thematic analysis of eight evaluator interviews were conducted.  Results were triangulated to reveal that the five Governor's Schools met (n= 80.0%) or exceeded (n= 13.87%) evaluation metric standards, and shared similar strengths and areas of needed improvement. Triangulated evidence supported the argument that the instrument addresses gifted students as independent learners, faculty as education innovators, and promotes STEM-capable citizens through scientific research and civic service. Information collected during the study was intended to assist evaluation designers in determining rubric efficacy and provide recommendations for planned future revisions.\",","2700":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2701":"\"description-provenance\": [","2702":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-31T08:00:25Z (GMT).

The subjects of the research came to the United States as a part of the Somali Bantu resettlement in 2004. The study begins with a trajectory analysis of the people now known as Somali Bantu, beginning with their forced migration to Somalia and the various factors shaping their status in the country. The analysis continues through the period of displacement, flight, and human warehousing in the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps of Kenya and includes an examination of how bureaucratic labeling as refugees, and the public rhetoric of mainstream media further shaped the story of the Somali Bantu. Each of these moments through the refugee trajectory are foundational to the self-representations emerging in diaspora.   Using autoethnographic and portraiture methodologies, the author analyzes the subjects' discursive practices associated with cultural sustainability, as well as deployment of social media in rejecting and resisting social and cultural influences that threaten the integrity of Somali Bantu identity in the United States. The dissertation also situates the subjects within the broader Somali Bantu diaspora in the United States and Europe as they create home through a Somali Bantu aesthetic, form community through mutual assistance associations, construct mediascapes that circulates information globally, and build a transnational movement that aims to end the suffering of Wagosha people in Somalia. Overall, the research demonstrates the discursivity of identity, showing how a particular group reconstitutes itself through engagements with multiple and often disparate cultures, traditions, languages, and histories.\",","2744":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","2745":"\"description-provenance\": [","2746":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-31T08:00:33Z (GMT).

This study found that unlike both male and female secondary principals in the Midwest (Eckman, 2004), role conflict and role commitment had no statistically significant relationship with job satisfaction for this population.  Role commitment and role conflict, however, had a significant, positive relationship where those more committed to work first felt greater internal role conflict while those committed to important relationships first felt less internal role conflict. Finally, professional vs. self was the factor that created the most role conflict while the nature of work and co-workers were factors that contribute most to job satisfaction while operating conditions was the weakest source of job satisfaction.\",","2787":"\"description-degree\": \"EDD\",","2788":"\"description-provenance\": [","2789":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-01T08:00:15Z (GMT).

Protocols to examine professional practice, engage in data-driven decision-making (DDDM), and look at student work have gained more notoriety as school reform strategies in K-12 education.      The purpose of this single-case embedded common qualitative case study was to examine and describe how Uprising Elementary School (UES), in the mid-Atlantic part of the United States, made changes during the school reform process that benefited students from 2012 to 2015.  Qualitative data were collected through interviews, focus groups, observations, document reviews, and reflexive notes.  I used NVivo 11 Pro to store the data transcripts by creating specific nodes and the constant comparative analysis method to determine themes in the data collected.

In the second project, we develop a germinal center model to understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of potent long-lived plasma. We predict that the T follicular helper cells are a limiting resource and present possible mechanisms that can revert this limitation in the presence of non-mutating and mutating antigen. Finally, we develop a pharmacokinetic model of 3BNC117 antibody dynamics and HIV viral dynamics following antibody therapy.

Employees of color makeup one-third of the workforce, yet higher education institutions have been slow to adjust to the shifting demographics (Birnbaum, 1988; Brown, 2004; Yancey, 2010).  Higher education leaders are seeking ways to recruit and retain growing numbers of administrators of color working at their institutions.  Available research focuses on organizational fit and faculty of color (Bozeman and Gaughan, 2011; Jackson, 2003b; Jayakumar et al., 2009; Ortega-Liston and Rodriguez Soto, 2014; Victorino et al., 2013) or examines organizational fit at research universities (Barrett and Smith, 2008; Gasman et al., 2011; Ryan et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2011).  A review of the literature shows there is scarcity of scholarly knowledge on the experiences of administrators from historically minoritized groups with organizational fit at small liberal arts institutions.      The purpose of this study was to understand and describe how administrators of color at small liberal arts institutions experience organizational fit.  The conceptual framework for this study was Jackson's (2004a) Engagement, Retention, and Advancement (ERA) Model.  The participants in the sample included Black/African American, Asian American, Native Hawaii/Pacific Islander, and Latina/o non-academic administrators from institutions with less than 2,500 students.     Using a phenomenological design, I interviewed selected administrators twice using a modified version of Seidman's (2013) life history structure.  Data analysis revealed six themes including the pathways into higher education, attraction to small liberal arts institutions, institutional culture, position empowerment, multiple hats/roles, and professional success.  The findings suggest these administrators of color experience similar ERA processes as other administrators.  These similarities include desiring to fit in, an on-going process of building trust, and enjoying the small family business environment of a small liberal arts institution.  Unique findings included how participants valued their quality of life despite limited salaries at small liberal arts institutions.

For each problem, the developed computational model is verified by comparing computed results for example problems with those available in the literature.        Effective utilization of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and single layer graphene sheets (SLGSs) as reinforcements in nanocomposites requires their strong binding with the surrounding matrix. An effective technique to enhance this binding is to functionalize SWCNTs and SLGSs by covalent attachment of appropriate chemical groups. However, this damages their pristine structures that may degrade their mechanical properties. Here, we delineate using molecular mechanics simulations effects of covalent functionalization on elastic moduli of these nanomaterials. It is found that Young's modulus and the shear modulus of an SWCNT (SLGS), respectively, decrease by about 34% (73%) and 43% (42%) when 20% (10%) of carbon atoms are functionalized for each of the four functional groups of different polarities studied.       A shell theory that gives results close to the solution of the corresponding 3-dimensional problem depends upon the shell geometry, applied loads, and initial and boundary conditions. Here, by using a third order shear and normal deformable theory and the finite element method (FEM), we delineate for a doubly curved shell deformed statically with general tractions and subjected to different boundary conditions effects of geometric parameters on in-plane and transverse stretching and bending deformations. These results should help designers decide when to consider effects of these deformation modes for doubly curved shells.       Composite laminates are usually fabricated by curing resin pre-impregnated fiber layers in an autoclave under prescribed temperature and pressure cycles. A challenge is to reduce residual stresses developed during this process and simultaneously minimize the cure cycle time. Here, we use the FEM and a genetic algorithm to find the optimal cycle parameters. It is found that in comparison to the manufacturer's recommended cycle, for a laminate with the span/thickness of 12.5, one optimal cycle reduces residual stresses by 47% and the total cure time from 5 to 4 hours, and another reduces the total cure time to 2 hours and residual stresses by 8%.\",","3006":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3007":"\"description-provenance\": [","3008":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-06T08:00:16Z (GMT).

Although an increased availability of computational resources has enabled high-fidelity simulations (e.g. large eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation) of turbulent flows, the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations based models are still the dominant tools for industrial applications. However, the predictive capability of RANS models is limited by potential inaccuracies driven by hypotheses in the Reynolds stress closure. With the ever-increasing use of RANS simulations in mission-critical applications, the estimation and reduction of model-form uncertainties in RANS models have attracted attention in the turbulence modeling community. In this work, I focus on estimating uncertainties stemming from the RANS turbulence closure and calibrating discrepancies in the modeled Reynolds stresses to improve the predictive capability of RANS models. Both on-line and off-line data are utilized to achieve this goal. The main contributions of this dissertation can be summarized as followsFirst, a physics-based, data-driven Bayesian framework is developed for estimating and reducing model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. An iterative ensemble Kalman method is employed to assimilate sparse on-line measurement data and empirical prior knowledge for a full-field inversion. The merits of incorporating prior knowledge and physical constraints in calibrating RANS model discrepancies are demonstrated and discussed. Second, a random matrix theoretic framework is proposed for estimating model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. Maximum entropy principle is employed to identify the probability distribution that satisfies given constraints but without introducing artificial information. Objective prior perturbations of RANS-predicted Reynolds stresses in physical projections are provided based on comparisons between physics-based and random matrix theoretic approaches. Finally, a physics-informed, machine learning framework towards predictive RANS turbulence modeling is proposed. The functional forms of model discrepancies with respect to mean flow features are extracted from the off-line database of closely related flows based on machine learning algorithms. The RANS-modeled Reynolds stresses of prediction flows can be significantly improved by the trained discrepancy function, which is an important step towards the predictive turbulence modeling.\",","3057":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3058":"\"description-provenance\": [","3059":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-06T08:00:24Z (GMT).

The survey results suggest that participants support the VHSL's authority to impose probation which would prohibit the participation of coaches and sponsors, member schools, and participants. Additionally, the survey results suggest that the majority of participants believe the VHSL is performing well and that home-schooled students should not be able to participate in VHSL athletics and activities.

Older adults are remaining in their homes in increasing numbers and are part of a paradigm shift that is transferring healthcare services from a centralized institutional model to a decentralized home-based model. However, a majority of homes older adults reside in lack basic accessibility features and are in predominantly suburban locations that have limited transportation options. Villages, a multi-faceted aging support program, were established to address limitations encountered by older adults as they age in their homes and communities. These volunteer-based, membership organizations are becoming a popular and rapidly adopted community-based intervention, but research on Villages has been limited. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine how two groups of older adults living in a suburban Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC) aged in community. One group belonged to a Village and the other did not. The theory of residential normalcy provided the theoretical framework for examining how the older adults adapted to their environments through service use and support. Data analysis from interviews revealed four themesaccess to information among the Village members and nonmembers; the role of social networks; useful services when aging in community; and the importance of trusted guidance as provided by the Village director. Because Village members have access to additional and consistent support sources, may be better able maintain residential normalcy and therefore age in community longer and more safely than non-members.\",","3149":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3150":"\"description-provenance\": [","3151":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-08T08:00:14Z (GMT).

However, little is known about the ways in which engineering students construct or develop their personal and professional identities as influenced by the disciplinary values, behaviors, and practices learned during the undergraduate education experience. In order to deepen the understanding of professional identity formation within the engineering disciplines, a grounded theory study was conducted to explore the experiences of 31 sophomore, junior, and senior level undergraduate students enrolled in a civil engineering program. Upon conducting an iterative process of data collection and analysis, a theory of professional identity negotiation emerged from interviews depicting participants' experiences. This theory titled Negotiating EquilibriumAdvancing from Outsider to Insider or the AOI Model, captures the identities negotiated by students as they iteratively define, adjust, and readjust definitions of self and profession to maintain a balance between their personal self and the learned disciplinary identity of the civil engineering profession. As participants gained this balance, they began to see themselves as professionals and advance from an outsider (i.e., one not belonging to the civil engineering profession) to an insider (i.e., one belonging to the civil engineering profession). The AOI Model provides a framework for researchers to further explore professional identity formation, promotes the development of identity-influencing coursework and instructor teaching approaches, and inspires future research trajectories in engineering and civil engineering education.\",","3239":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3240":"\"description-provenance\": [","3241":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-12T08:00:15Z (GMT).

Lean premixed combustion has been found as one of the solutions to these objectives. However, since less amount of air is available for backside cooling of liner walls, it becomes very important to characterize the convective heat transfer that occurs on the inside wall of the combustor liners. These studies were explored using laboratory scale experiments as well as numerical approaches for several inlet flow conditions under both non-reacting and reacting flows. These studies may be expected to provide valuable insights for the industrial design communities towards identifying thermal hot spot locations as well as in quantifying the heat transfer magnitude, thus aiding in effective designs of the liner walls.  Lean premixed gas turbine combustor flows involve  strongly coupled interactions between several aspects of physics such as the degree of swirl imparted by the inlet fuel nozzle, premixing of the fuel and incoming air, lean premixed combustion within the combustor domain, the interaction of swirling flow with combustion driven heat release resulting in flow dilation, the resulting pressure fluctuations  leading to thermo-acoustic  instabilities there by creating a feedback loop with incoming reactants resulting in flow instabilities leading to flame lift off, flame extinction etc. Hence understanding combustion driven swirling flow in combustors continues to be a topic of intense research. In the present study, numerical predictions of swirl driven combustor flows were analyzed for a specific swirl number of an industrial fuel nozzle (swirler) using a commercial computational fluid dynamics tool and compared against in-house experimental data. The latter data was obtained from a newly developed test rig at Applied Propulsion and Power Laboratory (APPL) at Virginia Tech. The simulations were performed and investigated for several flow Reynolds numbers under non-reacting condition using various two equation turbulence models as well as a scale resolving model. The work was also extended to reacting flow modeling (using a partially premixed model) for a specific Reynolds number. These efforts were carried out in order investigate the flow behavior and also characterize convective heat transfer along the combustor wall (liner). Additionally, several parametric studies were performed towards investigating the effect of combustor geometry on swirling flow and liner hear transfer; and also to investigate the effect of inlet swirl on the jet impingement location along the liner wall under both non-reacting as well as reacting conditions. The numerical results show detailed comparison against experiments for swirling flow profiles within the combustor under reacting conditions indicating a good reliability of steady state modeling approaches for reacting conditions; however, the limitations of steady state RANS turbulence models were observed for non-reacting swirling flow conditions, where the flow profiles deviate from experimental observations in the central recirculation region. Also, the numerical comparison of liner wall heat transfer characteristics against experiments showed a sensitivity to Reynolds numbers. These studies offer to provide preliminary insights of RANS predictions based on commercial CFD tools in predicting swirling, non-reacting and reacting flow and heat transfer. They can be extended to reacting flow heat transfer studies in future and also may be upgraded to unsteady LES predictions to complement future experimental observations conducted at the in-house test facility.\",","3285":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3286":"\"description-provenance\": [","3287":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-12T08:00:23Z (GMT).

To meet the demands of higher conversion efficiency and power density, there is a growing need to simplify the process of fabricating magnetics for better integration with other power electronics components. The potential benefits of additive manufacturing (AM), or more commonly known as three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies, include shorter lead times, mass customization, reduced parts count, more complex shapes, less material waste, and lower life-cycle energy usage\u2014all of which are needed for manufacturing power magnetics. In this work, an AM technology for fabricating and integrating magnetic components, including the design of manufacturing methodology and the development of the feedstock material, was investigated.  A process flow chart of additive manufacturing functional multi-material parts was developed and applied for the fabrication of magnetic components. One of the barriers preventing the application of 3D-printing in power magnetics manufacturing is the lack of compatible and efficient magnetic materials for the printer's feedstock. In this work, several magnetic-filled-benzocyclobutene (BCB) pastes curable below 250 degree C were formulated for a commercial multi-material extrusion-based 3D-printer to form the core part. Two magnetic fillers were usedround-shaped particles of permalloy, and flake-shaped particles of Metglas 2750M. To guide the formulation, 3D finite-element models of the composite, consisting of periodic unit cells of magnetic particles and flakes in the polymer-matrix, was constructed. Ansoft Maxwell was used to simulate magnetic properties of the composite. Based on the simulation results, the pastes consisted of 10 wt% of BCB and 90 wt% of magnetic fillers\u2014the latter containing varying amounts of Metglas from 0 to 12.5 wt%. All the pastes displayed shear thinning behavior and were shown to be compatible with the AM platform. However, the viscoelastic behavior of the pastes did not exhibit solid-like behavior, instead requiring layer-by-layer drying to form a thick structure during printing. The key properties of the cured magnetic pastes were characterized. For example, bulk DC electrical resistivity approached 107 \u03a9\u22c5cm, and the relative permeability increased with Metglas addition, reaching a value of 26 at 12.5 wt%. However, the core loss data at 1 MHz and 5 MHz showed that the addition of Metglas flakes also increased core loss density.   To demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating magnetic components via 3D-printing, several inductors of differing structural complexities (planar, toroid, and constant-flux inductors) were designed. An AM process for fabricating magnetic components by using as-prepared magnetic paste and a commercial nanosilver paste was developed and optimized. The properties of as-fabricated magnetic components, including inductance and DC winding resistance, were characterized to prove the feasibility of fabricating magnetic components via 3D-printing. The microstructures of the 3D-printed magnetic components were characterized by Scanning-electron-microscope (SEM). Results indicate that both the winding and core magnetic properties could be improved by adjusting the formulation and flow characteristics of the feed paste, by fine-tuning printer parameters (e.g., motor speed, extrusion rate, and nozzle size), and by updating the curing profile in the post-process.  The main contributions of this study are listed below 1. Developed a process flow chart for additive manufacturing of functional multi-material components. This methodology can be used as a general reference in any other research area targeting the utilization of AM technology.   2. Designed, formulated and characterized low-temperature curable magnetic pastes. The pastes are physically compatible with the additive manufacturing platform and have applications in the area of power electronics integration.  3. Provided an enhanced understanding of the core-loss mechanisms of soft magnetic materials and soft magnetic composites at high frequency applications.\",","3331":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3332":"\"description-provenance\": [","3333":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-12T08:00:31Z (GMT).

The investigation presented herein analyzes selected factors related to community college success of Virginia Middle College completers who earned the GED\u00ae via the Middle College program at eight Virginia community colleges from 2006-2013.  Initial foundational information was provided by the Virginia Community College Student Information System (VCCSIS) dataset. Quantitative research methods including contingency table and logistic regression were used to analyze selected factors leading to Virginia Middle College program completion and subsequent community college success, including attainment of a community college career studies certificate, a community college applied sciences degree, a community college transfer degree to a four-year college or university, and a workplace credential such as the Virginia Career Readiness Certificate (CRC). Virginia Middle College completers who achieved community college success in 2006-2013 were then administered a survey instrument to investigate the completers' perceptions of the effectiveness of the community college support services offered within the respective community college.  Results indicate that age played an important role in GED completion within the Middle College program and that the younger aged participants were more likely to complete GED on time (within one year of enrollment in Middle College).  A greater number of Middle College completers earned a community college career studies certificate than any other credential earned and different community colleges have statistically significant different proportions of earned degrees and certificates.  With Middle College participants closely connected with staff in the program, the results of this study also suggested that coaching and mentoring further promoted success and completion of postsecondary pathways.  Another finding was that attendance on college campuses apparently motivated students to complete their GED and transition to and complete a postsecondary certificate or degree.\",","3378":"\"description-degree\": \"EDD\",","3379":"\"description-provenance\": [","3380":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-13T08:00:14Z (GMT).

Green communication is expected to be a primary goal in next generation cellular systems because it promises to reduce operating costs.  The first key issue is energy efficiency of distributed antenna systems (DASs). The power consumption of high power amplifiers (HPAs) used in wireless communication systems is determined by the transmit power and drain efficiency. For unequal power allocation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the drain efficiency of the PA is determined by the PAPR and hence by the power distribution. This research proposes a PAPR-aware energy-efficient resource allocation scheme for joint orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)/space division multiple access (SDMA) downlink transmission from DASs. Grouping-based SDMA is applied to exploit the spatial diversity while avoiding performance degradation from correlated channels. The developed scheme considers the impact of both system data rate and effective power consumption on the PAPR during resource allocation. We also present a suboptimal joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithm to facilitate implementation of power-efficient multi-channel wireless communications. By solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, a closed-form solution for the power allocation of each remote radio head is obtained.   The second key issue is related with PAPR reduction in the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The large number of PAs in next generation massive MIMO cellular communication system requires using inexpensive PAs at the base station to keep array cost reasonable. Large-scale multiuser (MU) MIMO systems can provide extra spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) for PAPR reduction. This work applies both recurrent neural network (RNN)- and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based schemes for different purposes to reduce PAPR. The highly parallel structure of RNN is proposed in this work to address the issues of scalability and stringent requirements on computational times in PAPR-aware precoding problem. An SDR-based framework is proposed to reduce PAPR that accommodates channel uncertainties and intercell coordination. Both of the proposed structures reduce linearity requirements and enable the use of lower cost RF components for large-scale MU-MIMO-OFDM downlink.  The third key issue is digital predistortion (DPD) in the massive MIMO systems. The primary source of nonlinear distortion in wireless transmitters is the PA, which is commonly modeled using polynomials. Conventional DPD schemes use high-order polynomials to accurately approximate and compensate for the nonlinearity of the PA. This is impractical for scaling to tens or hundreds of PAs in massive MIMO systems. This work therefore proposes a scalable DPD method, achieved by exploiting massive DoFs of next generation front ends. We propose a novel indirect learning structure which adapts the channel and PA distortion iteratively by cascading adaptive zero-forcing precoding and DPD. Experimental results show that over 70% of computational complexity is saved for the proposed solution, it is shown that a 3rd order polynomial with the new solution achieves the same performance as the conventional DPD using 11th order polynomial for a 100x10 massive MIMO configuration.\",","3423":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3424":"\"description-provenance\": [","3425":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-13T08:00:21Z (GMT).

However, the largely unstructured nature of free-choice learning calls for alternative approaches that can effectively engage groups of school age students with diverse cultural backgrounds. In these informal learning spaces employing digital content, classroom-size student groups do not get adequate exposure to content and if they do, it is either through individual interactions with digital exhibits or in a passive style instruction offered by a museum docent to the whole group. This research aims to identify which elements of collocated group collaboration, virtual environments, and serious games can be leveraged for an enhanced learning experience for small and large groups of middle school students.   We created a conceptual framework based on the Contextual Model of Learning in museums (John H. Falk and Dierking, 2000) and the most effective educational elements of Virtual Environments (VEs) and Serious Games, in order to increase engagement and social presence and facilitate learning. We then developed C-OLiVE (Collaborative Orchestrated Learning in Virtual Environments), an interactive virtual learning environment supporting group collaboration, which we used as a testbed to respond to our research questions. Our overall hypothesis is that synchronous, collocated, group collaboration will afford greater learning and an improved game experience compared to the conventional approaches used in these spaces so far.   We ran three experiments and a case study with 790 students in private and public middle schools, summer camps, and museums both in the US and in Greece. Findings partly supported our hypothesis, mainly during our small group interaction experiments, in which simultaneous interaction of students was found to be associated with increased learning. Guidance of a passive experience was effective in facilitating the more cognitively challenged group of students in a Greek museum. Our audience interaction studies revealed increased retention of information two days after the game. Agency was found to significantly predict learning in all our studies. Engagement and social presence were mostly correlated with higher levels of involvement and agency in the game.\",","3469":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3470":"\"description-provenance\": [","3471":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-15T08:00:16Z (GMT).

While institutions recruit underrepresented students and faculty, retention of these populations continues to be an issue in part due to a lack of sense of belonging (Booker, 2007; Hurtado and Carter, 1997), poor institutional climate (Hurtado, Alvarez, Guillermo-Wann, Cuellar, and Arellano, 2012; Rhee, 2008), and institutional racism (Stanley, 2006).  Organizational culture theory offers a lens to examine the underlying structural problems preventing organizations from permanently adopting diversity and inclusion initiatives throughout the institution.    This qualitative study examines how faculty members describe organizational culture of diversity and inclusion at a research university with a high degree of student diversity.  The conceptual framework was Schein's (2010) organizational culture model. Participants included 19 faculty members who identified as Caucasian/White, African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino, or Asian/Pacific Islander.  Of all participants, 12 were male and seven female.   In-person interviews were conducted to gather data.  Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method.  Five themes emergedforming culture, describing diversity and inclusion within the culture, learning impacted by diversity, feeling the culture, and directing culture.  Unique findings from this study reveal that participants believed there is a shifting organizational culture of diversity and inclusion at the selected institution due to newly acquired designations, causing redefinition of existing assumptions.  Additionally, faculty members (a) held different definitions for diversity and inclusion, which affected how they understood the university's responsibilities; (b) relied on localized diversity initiatives over university-wide ones; (c) believed in the unique needs of a highly diverse student body; and (d) were concerned with gaining diversity and inclusion at all ranks of the institution.  Findings suggest that faculty at this institution viewed the organizational culture of diversity and inclusion to be welcoming for students.  However, participants' perspectives were mixed about this same culture being welcoming to all faculty members.  The study has implications for administrators and faculty members seeking to create more diverse and inclusive organizational cultures.  Findings also have implications for future research on organizational culture, faculty, diversity, and inclusion.\",","3512":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3513":"\"description-provenance\": [","3514":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-15T08:00:23Z (GMT).

Two areas of research where protein engineering has allowed for many advances in biomedical materials include the design of novel protein scaffolds for molecular recognition, as well as the use of recombinant proteins for production of next generation biomaterials. The main focus of my dissertation was to develop new biomedical materials using protein engineering.   Chapters three and four discuss the engineering of repeat proteins as bio-recognition modules for biomedical sensing and imaging. Chapter three provides an overview of the most recent advances in engineering of repeat proteins in the aforementioned field. Chapter four discusses my contribution to this field. We have designed a de novo repeat protein scaffold based on the consensus sequence of the leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of the NOD family of cytoplasmic innate immune system receptors. Innate immunity receptors have been described as pattern recognition receptors in that they recognize \\"global features\\" of a family of pathogens versus one specific antigen. In mammals, two main protein families of such receptors areextracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic Nucletide-binding domain- and Leucine-rich Repeat-containing proteins (NLRs). NLRs are defined by their tripartite domain architecture that contains a C-terminal LRR (Leucine Rich Repeat) domain, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization (NACHT) domain, and the N-terminal effector domain. It is proposed that pathogen sensing in NLRs occurs through ligand binding by the LRR domain. Thus, we hypothesized that LRRs would be suitable for the design of alternative binding scaffolds for use in molecular recognition.   The NOD protein family plays a very important role in innate immunity, and consequently serves as a promising scaffold for design of novel recognition motifs. However, engineering of de novo proteins based on the NOD family LRR domain has proven challenging due to problems arising from protein solubility and stability. Consensus sequence design is a protein design tool used to create novel proteins that capture sequence-structure relationships and interactions present in nature in order to create a stable protein scaffold. We implement a consensus sequence design approach to develop proteins based on the LRR domain of NLRs. Using a multiple sequence alignment we analyzed all individual LRRs found in mammalian NLRs. This design resulted in a consensus sequence protein containing two internal repeats and separate N- and C- capping repeats named CLRR2. Using biophysical characterization methods of size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism, and fluorescence, CLRR2 was found to be a stable, monomeric, and cysteine free scaffold. Additionally, CLRR2, without any affinity maturation, displayed micromolar binding affinity for muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a bacterial cell wall fragment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct interaction of a NOD LRR with a physiologically relevant ligand. Furthermore, CLRR2 demonstrated selective recognition to the biologically active stereoisomer of MDP. Results of this study indicate that LRRs are indeed a useful scaffold for development of specific and selective proteins for molecular recognition, creating much potential for future engineering of alternative protein scaffolds for biomedical applications.  My second research interest focused on the development of proteins for novel biomaterials. In the past two decades, keratin biomaterials have shown impressive results as scaffolds for tissue engineering, wound healing, and nerve regeneration. In addition to its intrinsic biocompatibility, keratin interacts with specific cell receptors eliciting beneficial biochemical cues, as well as participates in important regulatory functions such as cell migration and proliferation and protein signalling. The aforementioned properties along with keratins' inherent capacity for self-assembly poise it as a promising scaffold for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications.  However, due to the extraction process used to obtain natural keratin proteins from natural sources, protein damage and formation of by-products that alter network self-assembly and bioactivity often occur as a result of the extensive processing conditions required. Furthermore, natural keratins require exogenous chemistry in order to modify their properties, which greatly limits sequence tunability.   Recombinant keratin proteins have the potential to overcome the limitations associated with the use of natural keratins while also maintaining their desired structural and chemical characteristics. Thus, we have used recombinant DNA technology for the production of human hair keratins, keratin 31 (K31) and keratin 81 (K81). The production of recombinant human hair keratins resulted in isolated proteins of the correct sequence and molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Proteins with no unwanted sequence truncations, deletions, or mutations indicate recombinant DNA technology can be used to reliably generate full length keratin proteins. This allows for consistent starting materials with no observable impurities or undesired by-products, which combats a major challenge associated with natural keratins. Additionally, recombinant keratins must maintain the intrinsic propensity for self-assembly found in natural keratins. To test the propensity for self-assembly, we implemented size exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize K31, K81, and an equimolar mixture of K31 and K81. The results of the recombinant protein characterization reveal novel homo-polymerization of K31 and K81, not previously reported, and formation of characteristic keratin fibers for the K31 and K81 mixture. Therefore, recombinant K31 and K81 retain the intrinsic biological activity (i.e. self-assembly) of natural keratin proteins. We have also conducted a comparative study of recombinant and extracted heteropolymer K31/K81. Through solution characterization and TEM analysis it was found that use of the recombinant heteropolymer allows for increased purity of starting material while also maintaining self-assembly properties necessary for functional use in biomaterials design. However, under the processing condition implemented, extracted keratins demonstrated increased efficiency of assembly. Through each study we conclude that recombinant keratin proteins provide a promising solution to overcome the challenges associated with natural protein materials and present an exceptional design platform for generation of new biomaterials for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.\",","3558":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3559":"\"description-provenance\": [","3560":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-18T08:00:13Z (GMT).

There are three basic types of particle acceleratorslinear accelerators (linac), storage-ring (or circular) accelerators, and recirculating accelerators. The third type, also the most recent one, is designed to accelerate a particle beam in a short section of linac, circulate and then continue to accelerate it for energy boost or decelerate it for energy recovery. The modern recirculating machines possess the advantages to both accelerate and preserve the beam with high beam quality, as well as efficiently reuse the accelerating components. As modern accelerators push toward the high-brightness or high-intensity frontier by demanding particles in a highly charged bunch to concentrate in an ever-decreasing beam phase space, the interaction amongst particles via their self-generated electromagnetic fields can potentially lead to coherent instabilities of the beam and thus pose significant challenges to the machine design and operation. Microbunching instability (MBI) has been one of the most challenging issues for such high-brightness or high-intensity beam transport, as it would degrade lasing performance in the fourth-generation light sources, reduce cooling efficiency in electron cooling facilities, and eventually compromise the luminosity of colliding beams in lepton or lepton-hadron colliders.    The dissertation work will focus on the MBI in modern recirculating electron accelerators. The research attempts to develop a comprehensive theoretical formulation of MBI with aspects including among various degrees of freedoms the beam itself, the beamline lattice optics, and incorporation of all relevant collective effects that the beam encounters, for example the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and the longitudinal space charge (LSC) effects. This dissertation includes the following seven themes1) Development and generalization of MBI theory to arbitrary linear lattices and coupled beams with constant and varying energies; 2) Construction of CSR impedance models from steady state to transient state and from high to low energy regime; 3) Numerical implementation of the developed theory as a fast and numerical-noise-free Vlasov solver and benchmarking with massive particle tracking simulation; 4) Exploration of multistage cascaded amplification mechanism of CSR microbunching development; 5) Control of CSR-induced MBI in multi-bend transport or recirculation arcs; 6) Study of more aspects of microbunched structures in beam phase spaces; and 7) Study of MBI for magnetized beams and confirming the suppression of MBI for a recent cooler design for Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider project.\",","3602":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3603":"\"description-provenance\": [","3604":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-21T08:00:20Z (GMT).

This   phenomenon of young Korean students studying overseas is termed jogi yuhak, which  can be directly translated as Early Study Abroad (ESA). The phenomenon of ESA has  stirred both interests and concerns to Korean society for more than a decade. At the same  time, American schools are beginning to see more of these ESA students in their  classrooms, as a result of the United States being the preferred destination country for  more than one-third of the ESA students in Korea. Although the growing presence of  ESA students in school classrooms has begun to attract increasing attention from  educators and researchers in the United States, there are no clear statistics investigating  the numbers of ESA students in the United States, and that most school officials are even  unaware of the trend.  The qualitative phenomenological study was used to explore the  lived experiences of Korean ESA students in the United States in relation to their  adaption to their new environment, as well as the factors that they perceive to help or  challenge them in attaining successful adaption.  Ten Korean Early Study Abroad  (KESA) students attending schools in the Washington Metropolitan region were recruited  for this study, and face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather  information regarding experiences and perceptions of KESA students in the United States.   Findings show that most KESA students feel that having friends, participating in  extracurricular activities and maintaining contacts with their families and friends in  Korea using social media and instant messaging helped them as they made the transition  into American culture.  Students also indicated that the language barrier, being away  from family, not owning a car, difficulty keeping in touch with old friends, cultural  differences and racism are the most serious challenges for them during their adaptation  period.  This research documents the unique challenges faced by KESA students and  provide a helpful guideline for counselors and educators working with ESA students from  Korea, as well as indicate the directions that should be pursued by further research.\",","3646":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3647":"\"description-provenance\": [","3648":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-22T08:00:28Z (GMT).

Studying plume-derived lavas can clarify important planetary-scale questions relating to the accretion of the Earth, primordial geochemical reservoirs, the fate of subducted materials, planetary differentiation, and convective mixing.\",","3732":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3733":"\"description-provenance\": [","3734":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-22T08:00:48Z (GMT).

Large tsunamis are relatively infrequent. Deposits are the only concrete evidence in the geological record with which we can determine both tsunami frequency and magnitude. Numerical modeling of sediment transport during a tsunami is important interdisciplinary research to estimate the frequency and magnitude of past events and quantitative prediction of future events. The goal of this dissertation is to develop robust, accurate, and computationally efficient models for sediment transport during a tsunami. There are two different modeling approaches (forward and inverse) to investigate sediment transport. A forward model consists of tsunami source, hydrodynamics, and sediment transport model. In this dissertation, we present one state-of-the-art forward model for Sediment TRansport In Coastal Hazard Events (STRICHE), which couples with GeoClaw and is referred to as GeoClaw-STRICHE. In an inverse model, deposit characteristics, such as grain-size distribution and thickness, are inputs to the model, and flow characteristics are outputs. We also depict one trial-and-error inverse model (TSUFLIND) and one data assimilation inverse model (TSUFLIND-EnKF) in this dissertation. All three models were validated and verified against several theoretical, experimental, and field cases.\",","3780":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3781":"\"description-provenance\": [","3782":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-22T08:00:56Z (GMT).

To elucidate findings of ultra-high vacuum experiments that probe the oxidation of carbon-carbon double bonds on model surfaces, we used electronic structure and QM/MM methods to study the reaction of ozone with C60-fullerene and the products of nitrate addition to a vinyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer. In the first system, we followed a reaction pathway beginning with primary ozonide formation through the formation of stable products. Theoretical vibrational spectra were used to identify a ketene product in prior experimental work. Next, through the construction of a multilayer model for the initial addition product of a nitrate radical to a chain embedded within a self-assembled monolayer, we report theoretical spectra that are consistent with experimental results. We then examined the fundamentals of the hydrolysis mechanism for nerve agents by a catalyst of interest in the development of filtration materials for chemical-warfare-agent defense. By following the gas-surface reaction pathway of the nerve agent Sarin on the Lindqvist polyoxoniobate Cs8Nb6O19, we determined that the rate-limiting step is the transfer of a proton from an adsorbed water molecule to the niobate surface, concomitant with the nucleophilic addition of the nascent hydroxide to the phosphorus atom in Sarin. Our results support a general base hydrolysis mechanism, though high product-adsorption energies suggest that thermal treatment of the system is required to fully regenerate the catalyst. We report similar mechanisms for the simulants dimethyl methylphosphonate and dimethyl chlorophosphate, though the latter may serve as a better simulant in studies of this type. Finally, an investigation of Sarin hydrolysis with solvated Cs8Nb6O19 shows an increase in the rate-limiting barrier relative to the gas-surface system, revealing the role of Cs counterions in the reaction. Then, we further increased explicit solvation to model the homogeneous solution-phase reaction, finding a different mechanism in which a water molecule adds to phosphorus in the rate-limiting step and protonation of the niobate surface occurs in a subsequent barrierless step. By examining the rate-limiting barrier for protonation, we suggest that specific base hydrolysis is also likely in the homogeneous system.\",","3864":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","3865":"\"description-provenance\": [","3866":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-25T22:28:38Z (GMT).

This family of models provides an appropriate basis for revisiting the empirical adequacy of the CAPM and the Fama-French multi-factor models, as well as other models, such as alternative asset pricing models and risk evaluation models. Along the lines of providing a sound basis for reliable inference, the respecified models can serve as a coherent basis for selecting the relevant factors from the set of possible ones.

In this dissertation, I examine when, how, and why loneliness influences consumer behavior. First, I develop an experimental method to induce loneliness and identify a circumstance that experimenters can obtain a successful loneliness priming effect. Across three experiments, I demonstrate that the same loneliness primes produce different loneliness responses based on the availability of cognitive resources. Specifically, participants who are cognitively depleted tend to rely on responses evoked by the loneliness primes (showing the intended loneliness priming effect) while those with abundant cognitive resources are not affected by the loneliness primes. Building on the findings from Experiments 1-3, I investigate how loneliness affects consumer behaviors in two different marketing contexts, nostalgic product consumption and charitable giving by focusing on how consumers cope with loneliness through consumption. In Experiments 4-5, I demonstrate that consumers who lack cognitive resources tend to form positive attitudes toward nostalgic products when experiencing loneliness. In Experiments 6-7, I show that lonely consumers with limited cognitive resources are likely to donate money to a charitable organization. Additionally, I find that consumers can regulate feelings of loneliness by spending money either for themselves (i.e., nostalgic products) or for others (i.e., charitable giving). This dissertation contributes to our understanding of loneliness in marketing by identifying a circumstance in which such emotional distress significantly influences consumer behavior and by showing how consumers spend money to cope with loneliness.\",","4053":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4054":"\"description-provenance\": [","4055":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-25T22:29:15Z (GMT).

SAM- dependent reactions result in three major metabolitesS-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), methylthioadenosine (MTA), and 5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-dA). Each of these has been demonstrated to be feedback inhibitors of SAM dependent enzymes.  Thus, each metabolite has a pathway to prevent inhibition through the salvage of nucleoside and ribose moieties. However, these salvage pathways are not universally conserved. In the anaerobic archaeal organism Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, the salvage of SAH, MTA, and 5'-dA, proceeds first via deamination to S-inosylhomocysteine (SIH), methylthioinosine (MTI), and 5'-deoxyinosine (5'-dI). The annotated SAH hydrolase from M. jannaschii is specific for SIH and the hydrolyzed product homocysteine is then methylated to methionine.  The salvage of MTA is known to proceed through the methionine salvage pathway, however, an anaerobic route for the salvage of MTA is still mostly unknown. Only two enzymes from the methionine salvage pathway are annotated in M. jannaschii's proteome, a methylthioinosine phosphorylase (MTIP) and methylthioribose 1-phosphate isomerase (MTRI). These enzymes were shown to produce methylthioribulose 1-phosphate from MTI.  Unfortunately, how MTI is converted to either 2-keto-(4-methylthio)butyrate or methionine remains unknown. The two enzymes involved in the salvage of MTI have also been demonstrated to be involved in the salvage of 5'-dI.  Interestingly, there is little information on how 5'-dA or 5'-dI is recycled and it is proposed here to be the source of deoxysugars for the production methylglyoxal, a precursor for aromatic amino acids.  MTIP and MTRI were demonstrated to produce 5-deoxyribulose 1-phosphate from 5'-dI.  Additionally, two enzymes annotated as part of the pentose phosphate pathway, ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase and transketolase, were able to convert 5-deoxyribulose 1-phosphate to lactaldehyde.  Lactaldehyde was then reduced to methylglyoxal by an essential enzyme in methanogenesis, N5, N10-methylenetetahydromethanopterin reductase with NADPH.  These results further demonstrate a novel route for the biosynthesis of methylglyoxal.  Lastly, hypoxanthine produced from phosphorolysis of inosine, MTI, and 5'-dI was demonstrated to be reincorporated through the hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hpt) to IMP.  Together these reactions represent novel pathways for the salvage of the SAM nucleoside and ribose moieties in M. jannaschii.\",","4096":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4097":"\"description-provenance\": [","4098":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-25T22:29:23Z (GMT).

Collectively, the concentration of water-soluble ions in streams is called total dissolved solids (TDS) and streams with elevated TDS often have altered biota.  The surficial, subsurface, and discharge properties of mine spoils influence TDS discharge concentrations. This study aimed to improve understanding of how hydrologic and hydrochemical processes occur and function in coal mining areas. These processes were characterized by infiltration and dye staining tests, mine spoil leaching experiments and modeling, and mining-influenced stream discharge monitoring. Results indicate that many factors influence hydrologic and hydrochemical processes in Appalachian coal mining areas, but these processes evolve over time as subsurface flow paths develop, mine rocks weather, and TDS is released from mine spoils.  Fourteen years after placement, mean infiltration rates of mine soils reclaimed with trees were statistically greater than areas reclaimed with grasses, and different subsurface flow types were evident, indicating vegetation type influenced hydrologic processes. Specific conductance (SC) leaching patterns from mine spoils conformed to an exponential decay and linear segmented regression model.  Maximum SC values (1108 \u00b1 161 \u00b5S cm\u207b\u00b9) occurred initially during leaching, exponentially decayed, then exhibited linear SC releases (276 \u00b1 25 \u00b5S cm\u207b\u00b9) that were elevated relative to natural background levels at the end of leaching. Major element (S, Ca, Mg, K, Na) leaching patterns resembled those of SC, whereas trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se) transitioned to linear release earlier in the leaching period.  Mining-influenced stream SC discharge patterns varied by season and by precipitation amounts during storm events. Storm responses were characterized by either infiltration-excess overland flow or delayed SC releases due to internal flow through the VF. Given these results, mining companies wishing to control TDS discharges may be selective and pre-test mine spoils for total S and paste SC to determine TDS-generation potential. Isolation of spoils with high-TDS release potentials (i.e. unweathered sandstones and mudstones) from water-rock contact may help improve TDS discharges.\",","4192":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4193":"\"description-provenance\": [","4194":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-27T08:00:24Z (GMT).

I investigate the premise that the experience of curiosity resolution is influenced both by the fact that curiosity is resolved, as well as how it is resolved. While the outcome associated with curiosity resolution can be positive or negative in nature, the experience of curiosity resolution itself is predicted to be pleasant in nature. Therefore, I propose that the degree to which each of these two resolution facets is salient will influence curiosity-related evaluations. In this dissertation, I investigate pre-resolution expectations as well as post-resolution downstream consequences. Prior to curiosity resolution, I propose that individuals are likely to be focused on the outcome they will obtain. However, when faced with uncertain outcomes, individuals strategically heighten anticipated feelings of disappointment in order to protect against actual disappointment when the outcome is revealed; thus, I predict and demonstrate in four studies that curious consumers will display heightened levels of pre-resolution feelings of anticipated disappointment. After curiosity resolution, I propose that individuals experience not only positive or negative feelings associated with the outcome obtained, but also positive feelings of resolution itself. In four studies, I investigate the power of curiosity resolution to buffer negative responses to relatively undesirable outcomes. Importantly, I also demonstrate that consumers' focus on either the outcome obtained or on the experience of resolution itself can be experimentally shifted, thereby mitigating the previously described effects.\",","4238":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4239":"\"description-provenance\": [","4240":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-27T08:00:30Z (GMT).

As a special case, we study the quantum sheaf cohomology of Grassmannians as a deformation of the usual quantum cohomology. The deformation corresponds to a (0,2) deformation of the nonabelian gauged linear sigma model whose geometric phase is associated with the Grassmannian. Combined with the classical result, the quantum ring structure is derived from the one-loop effective potential. Supersymmetric localization is also applicable in this case, which proves to be efficient in computing A/2 correlation functions. We then compute chiral operators in general (0,2) nonlinear sigma models, and apply them to the Gadde-Gukov-Putrov triality proposal, which says that certain triples of (0,2) GLSMs should RG flow to nontrivial IR fixed points. As another application, we extend previous works to construct  (0,2) Toda-like mirrors to the sigma model engineering Grassmannians.\",","4282":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4283":"\"description-provenance\": [","4284":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-27T08:00:38Z (GMT).

A new method of noise control based on the anatomy of owls is developed and consists of fabric or fibrous canopies suspended above the surface. The method is tested experimentally and is found to reduce the total far-field noise emitted by the surface. The treatment also is found to reduce the magnitude of pressure fluctuations felt by the underlying surface by up to three orders of magnitude. Experimental investigations into the effects of geometric parameters of the canopies lead to an optimized design which maximizes noise reduction.    The results obtained during the canopy experiment inspired a separate new device for the reduction of trailing edge noise. This type of noise is generated by flow past the wing of an aircraft or the blades of a wind turbine, and is a source of annoyance for those in surrounding communities. The newly developed treatment consists of small fins, or \\"finlets,\\" placed near the trailing edge of an airfoil. The treatment is tested experimentally at near-full-scale conditions and is found to reduce the magnitude of far-field noise by up to 10 dB. Geometric parameters of the finlets are tested to determine the optimal size and spacing of the finlets to maximize noise reduction. Follow-up computational and experimental studies reveal the fluid mechanics behind the noise reduction by showing that the finlets produce a velocity deficit in the flow near the trailing edge and limit the magnitude and spanwise correlation lengthscale of turbulence near the trailing edge, factors which determine the magnitude of far-field noise.    In a final experiment, the finlets are applied to a marine propeller and are found to reduce not only trailing edge noise, but also noise caused by the bluntness of the trailing edge. The results of this experiment show the potential usefulness of finlets to reduce noise from rotating systems, such as fans or propellers, as well as from structures which feature blunt trailing edges.\",","4331":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4332":"\"description-provenance\": [","4333":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-27T17:47:02Z (GMT).

This dissertation focuses on two aspects of facilitating the application of dc systems(a) system-level control to improve load sharing, voltage regulation and efficiency; (b) design of a high-efficiency interface converter to connect dc microgrids with the existing low-voltage ac distributions, with a special focus on common-mode (CM) voltage attenuation.    Droop control has been used in dc microgrids to share loads among multiple sources. However, line resistance and sensor discrepancy deteriorate the performance. The quantitative relation between the droop voltage range and the load sharing accuracy is derived to help create droop design guidelines. DC system designers can use the guidelines to choose the minimum droop voltage range and guarantee that the sharing error is within a defined range even under the worst cases.     A nonlinear droop method is proposed to improve the performance of droop control. The droop resistance is a function of the output current and increases when the output current increases. Experiments demonstrate that the nonlinear droop achieves better load sharing under heavy load and tighter bus voltage regulation. The control needs only local information, so the advantages of droop control are preserved. The output impedances of the droop-controlled power converters are also modeled and measured for the system stability analysis.    Communication-based control is developed to further improve the performance of dc microgrids. A generic dc microgrid is modeled and the static power flow is solved. A secondary control system is presented to achieve the benefits of restored bus voltage, enhanced load sharing and high system efficiency. The considered method only needs the information from its adjacent node; hence system expendability is guaranteed.    A high-efficiency two-stage single-phase ac-dc converter is designed to connect a 380 V bipolar dc microgrid with a 240 V split-phase single-phase ac system. The converter efficiencies using different two-level and three-level topologies with state-of-the-art semiconductor devices are compared, based on which a two-level interleaved topology using silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs is chosen. The volt-second applied on each inductive component is analyzed and the interleaving angles are optimized. A 10 kW converter prototype is built and achieves an efficiency higher than 97% for the first time.    An active CM duty cycle injection method is proposed to control the dc and low-frequency CM voltage for grounded systems interconnected with power converters. Experiments with resistive and constant power loads in rectification and regeneration modes validate the performance and stability of the control method. The dc bus voltages are rendered symmetric with respect to ground, and the leakage current is reduced. The control method is generalized to three-phase ac-dc converters for larger power systems.\",","4379":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4380":"\"description-provenance\": [","4381":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-27T17:53:36Z (GMT).

The current study was conducted to increase understanding of factors that promote or deter post-combat adaptation. In total, five research questions were posed and tested, leading to examination of how difficulties with emotion regulation, post-deployment coping self-efficacy (PDCSE), and disrupted worldview work in-concert to influence post-combat adaptation (as measured by PTSD severity, depression severity, and quality of life perceptions). Methods. The final sample included cross-sectional data for 123 OEF/OIF veterans who were referred for assessment and/or treatment in an outpatient clinic in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Path analysis, employing bootstrapping re-sampling, was used to test hypotheses, yielding metrics for model fit, direct effects, and hypothesized indirect effects. Results. Overall findings demonstrated that each of the models tested were a good fit for explaining post-combat adaptation outcomes, with the final integrated model (including combat exposure, difficulties with emotion regulation, PDCSE, and negative worldview) explaining 49% of the variance in PTSD, 60% of the variance in depression severity, and 42% of the variance in quality of life, respectively. Findings across all models demonstrated that emotion dysregulation played a significant role in promoting worse post-combat adaptation, and that this effect primarily worked through alterations in PDCSE and negative worldview. Conclusions. This study concludes with interpretation of findings via theory and the extant literature. Future research and intervention implications are discussed, including the need to focus post-combat therapies on altering PDCSE and negative worldview, and more broadly, on factors that diminish meaningful life for combat veterans.\",","4426":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4427":"\"description-provenance\": [","4428":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-27T17:56:15Z (GMT).

A map is a 2-cell embedding of a graph on an orientable surface. Motivated by a new way to read the information provided by the skeleton of a map, we introduce new objects called plane permutations. Plane permutations not only provide new insight into enumeration of maps and related graph embedding problems, but they also provide a powerful framework to study less related genome rearrangement problems. As results, we refine and extend several existing results on enumeration of maps by counting plane permutations filtered by different criteria. In the spirit of the topological, graph theoretical study of graph embeddings, we study the behavior of graph embeddings under local changes. We obtain a local version of the interpolation theorem, local genus distribution as well as an easy-to-check necessary condition for a given embedding to be of minimum genus. Applying the plane permutation paradigm to genome rearrangement problems, we present a unified simple framework to study transposition distances and block-interchange distances of permutations as well as reversal distances of signed permutations. The essential idea is associating a plane permutation to a given permutation or signed permutation to sort, and then applying the developed plane permutation theory.\",","4475":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4476":"\"description-provenance\": [","4477":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-28T06:21:25Z (GMT).

This dissertation focuses on two interesting problems in bioinformatics researchmicroRNA-target prediction and the identification of conserved protein complexes across species. We define the two problems and develop novel approaches for solving them. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that mediate gene expression. The goal is to predict microRNA targets. Existing methods rely on sequence features to predict targets. These features are neither sufficient nor necessary to identify functional target sites and ignore the cellular conditions in which microRNA and mRNA interact. We developed MicroTarget to predict microRNA-mRNA interactions using heterogeneous data sources. MicroTarget uses expression data to learn candidate target set for each microRNA. Then, sequence data is used to provide evidence of direct interactions and ranking the predicted targets. The predicted targets overlap with many of the experimentally validated ones. The results indicate that using expression data helps in predicting microRNA targets accurately. Protein complexes conserved across species specify processes that are core to cell machinery. Methods that have been devised to identify conserved complexes are severely limited by noise in PPI data. Behind PPIs, there are domains interacting physically to perform the necessary functions. Therefore, employing domains and domain interactions gives a better view of the protein interactions and functions. We developed novel strategy for local network alignment, DONA. DONA maps proteins into their domains and uses DDIs to improve the network alignment. We developed novel strategy for constructing an alignment graph and then uses this graph to discover the conserved sub-networks. DONA shows better performance in terms of the overlap with known protein complexes with higher precision and recall rates than existing methods. The result shows better semantic similarity computed with respect to both the biological process and the molecular function of the aligned sub-networks.\",","4520":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4521":"\"description-provenance\": [","4522":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-28T09:50:58Z (GMT).

These emissions are considered a major environmental threat. Consequently, decision makers desperately need tools that can estimate vehicle emissions accurately to quantify the impact of transportation operational projects on the environment. Microscopic fuel consumption and emission models should be capable of computing vehicle emissions reliably to assist decision makers in developing emission mitigation strategies. However, the majority of current state-of-the-art models suffer from two major shortcomings, namely; they either produce a bang-bang control system because they use a linear fuel consumption versus power model or they cannot be calibrated using publicly available data and thus require expensive laboratory or field data collection.  Consequently, this dissertation attempts to fill this gap in state-of-the-art emission modeling through a framework based on the Virginia Tech Comprehensive Power-Based Fuel consumption Model (VT-CPFM), which overcomes the above mentioned drawbacks. Specifically, VT-CPFM does not result in a bang-bang control and can be calibrated using publicly available vehicle and road pavement parameters. The main emphasis of this dissertation is to develop a simple and reliable emission model that is able to compute instantaneous emission rates of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for the light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs). The proposed extension is entitled Virginia Tech Comprehensive Power-Based Fuel consumption and Emission Model (VT-CPFEM). The study proposes two square root models where the first model structure is a cubic polynomial function that depends on fuel estimates derived solely from VT-CPFM fuel estimates, which enhances the simplicity of the model. The second modeling framework combines the cubic function of the VT-CPFM fuel estimates with a linear speed term. The additional speed term improves the accuracy of the model and can be used as a reference for the driving condition of the vehicle. Moreover, the model is tested and compared with existing models to demonstrate the robustness of the model. Furthermore, the performance of the model was further investigated by applying the model on driving cycles based on real-world driving conditions. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the model in replicating empirical observations reliably and simply with only two parameters.\",","4564":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4565":"\"description-provenance\": [","4566":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-28T10:11:32Z (GMT).

Envirox is a fuel-borne catalyst comprised of nanoparticles of cerium oxide suspended in kerosene.  The particles suspended in Envirox were confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and electron microscopy to be 5-7 nm crystals of CeO2 present as 15 nm aggregates.  Significant changes to the particles were induced by the combustion process, resulting in 50-300 nm euhedral crystals of CeO2 in the exhaust as discovered using high resolution transmission electron microscopy.  Single particle electron diffraction of the emitted cerium oxide particles showed evidence of ordered oxygen vacancies, indicative of a superstructure.  Variations in the engine operating load resulted in no significant differences in the emitted cerium oxide particles.  The mobility through soils and impacts on the plant Brassica napus (dwarf essex rape) of the emitted cerium oxide were compared to small and large CeO2 nanoparticles as well as diesel particulate matter emissions with very low cerium.  The small CeO2 nanoparticles exhibited high mobility through soils and significant uptake and translocation in the plants.  The large CeO2 nanoparticles showed extremely low mobility in soils and no significant increase in cerium anywhere in the plants.  Cerium emissions from a diesel engine utilizing Envirox was found to have moderate mobility through the soils as well as an increased association with the roots of the plants, though translocation of the cerium into the aboveground biomass was not statistically significant.   Despite uptake and translocation of some materials by B. napus, exposure to these cerium sources at 100 ppm Ce in the topsoil showed no significant impacts on the growth or overall health of the plants when compared to unexposed control samples.  This dissertation shows that CeO2 nanoparticles employed as catalysts suspended in diesel fuel are altered during their use resulting in changes to their mobility and interaction upon entering the environment.

The current study examined cultural differences in the role of maternal characteristics, specifically emotional awareness and emotion regulation, as determinants of emotion coaching.  These findings will facilitate culturally desired emotion socialization practices leading to optimal emotional development of children.    In the current study, I translated two English-based questionnaires into Chinese to assess maternal emotional awareness and emotion coaching.  Next, I examined relations of reappraisal, suppression, and emotional awareness to maternal emotion coaching.  I also investigated the role of maternal emotional awareness as a mediator in the relation of maternal use of reappraisal and suppression to maternal emotion coaching in both Chinese and American cultures.    Participants included American (n=164) and 163 Chinese (n=163) mothers.  Maternal emotional awareness was measured using subscales of Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.  Emotion regulation strategies were assessed using Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.  To measure emotion coaching, mothers completed Parents' Beliefs about Children's Emotions questionnaire.  Structural equation models were estimated to examine how maternal emotional awareness and emotion regulation related to emotion coaching.      Results confirmed the reliability and validity of the Chinese questionnaires. Maternal emotion coaching did not include mothers' views about negative emotions because equivalence could not be established across Chinese and American cultures; therefore, the emotion coaching discussed in this study is different from previous research on emotion coaching that typically involves responses to negative emotions.   Maternal emotional awareness was associated with their emotion coaching in both samples and the strength of the association was not different across cultures.  However, relations of reappraisal and suppression to emotional awareness and emotion coaching were different across Chinese and American samples.  Emotional awareness mediated the relation of reappraisal to emotion coaching only in the American sample.  Additionally, emotional awareness was a mediator of the relation of suppression to emotion coaching in both samples. Overall, the findings of this study supported that maternal emotional awareness and use of emotion regulation strategies are important determinants of maternal emotion coaching in both cultures.\",","4657":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4658":"\"description-provenance\": [","4659":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-29T08:00:17Z (GMT).

These macromolecules are comprised of numerous polymeric side-chains densely grafted to a polymer backbone. The densely grafted nature of bottlebrush polymers results in steric repulsion between neighboring polymer chains, forcing these macromolecules to adopt a chain-extended conformation. Although these remarkable macromolecules have a many different applications, the transformative potential of the bottlebrush polymer topology has not been realized because the synthesis of high molecular weight bottlebrush polymers is challenging. This dissertation focusses on improving the synthesis of these large macromolecules using the grafting-through strategy in the first section and the transfer-to strategy in the second section.   For the first time the effect of anchor group chemistry\ufffd\\"the configuration of atoms linking the polymer to a polymerizable norbornene\ufffd\\" was studied on the kinetics of ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of macromonomers (MMs) initiated by Grubbs 3rd generation catalyst. A variance in the rate of propagation of >4-fold between similar MMs with different anchor groups was observed. This phenomenon was conserved across all MMs tested, regardless of solvent, molecular weight (MW), or repeat unit identity. Experimental and computational studies indicated that the rate differences likely resulted from a combination of varying steric demands and electronic structure among the different anchor groups. This new insight will allow others to achieve high MM conversion and prepare pure, high MW bottlebrush polymers by ROMP grafting-through.   The second section of this dissertation deals with a little studied bottlebrush synthesis technique called the transfer-to method. This method is a hybrid of the grafting-from and grafting-to approaches in which the growing polymer side chains detach from the backbone, propagate freely in solution, and then reattach to the backbone in a chain transfer step. Several parameters were investigated to determine optimal conditions for this process. This study provides for the first time a guide to use the transfer-to method to produce high purity bottlebrush polymers with controllable backbone and side chain length.\",","4701":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4702":"\"description-provenance\": [","4703":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-02T08:00:19Z (GMT).

Combining grounded theory, case study methods, visual methods, and portions of the Authentic, Action-Oriented, Framing for Environmental Shifts Method (Watt, 2015), I was able to address the four research questions posed in this study.  I conducted interviews with participants involved in specific general classroom facilities design/construction while asking participants to co-create a diagram of the steps of the process.  The data collected from this process produced the Train Model of Design for General Classroom Facilities.    The process begins with the specifics of the institution or college and its chosen direction.  The conditions specific to the institution act as a departing station for the process.  The conditions specific to the wider context function as the rails on which the train moves.  The rails are held together by crossties consisting of the constant collaboration of the triumvirate and stakeholders.  A triumvirate consisting of the project manager, the construction manager, and the representative from the academic department move the project through each phase of the design process.  These decision-makers functions as the conductor of the train, driving the process while feeding it two distinct types of fuelbudget and time.  The triumvirate must continuously monitor the fuel supply to reach the end of the process.  In addition, the triumvirate continuously monitors the passengers, to incorporate their feedback into the trip.      The stages of the process function similarly to boarding and disembarking on a train.  In Stage 1 you prepare to leave the station.  You make a case for what travels on the train with you and what gets left at home.   You also determine the fuel needs of the train by setting the project budget and schedule.  Stage 2, or Making the Space, consists of the travel to the final destination, carrying along those well-laid plans from Stage 1.  The triumvirate drives the train while carefully monitoring the fuel levels.  You can make a few minor adjustments once you have left the stations, based on feedback from the passengers, but drastically altering the plans is not a viable option.  The type of train you drive represents the different ways in which the process can play out at specific campuses.  A passenger train works differently compared to a freight train.  The number and sequence of steps in the process of design will vary depending on the type of project you are undertaking (new construction vs. renovation), the available state procedures, and the timing of your procurement of a construction management firm (i.e. the different types of trains you can take).  The final destination of the train is the completed general classroom facility.\",","4743":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4744":"\"description-provenance\": [","4745":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-02T08:00:26Z (GMT).

Supplying N at 150 mg\u00b7L -1 during the growing season provided Echinacea cultivars adequate nutrition and maximized numbers of branches and flowers and shoot dry weight. In overwintering, fertilization treatments that resulted in low substrate electrical conductivity going into dormancy, 5.0 kg\u00b7m controlled release fertilizer 15N-3.9P-10K or 150 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9 N using 15N-2.2P-12.5K applied using constant liquid feed, resulted in the highest survival rates of Echinacea cultivars. As a monitoring tool, SPAD measurements were not successful in predicting tissue N levels in Echinacea hybrids. Twenty-one hybrid cultivars acquired as stage 3 tissue culture plantlets were grown under one of three photoperiods (10-hour, 16-hour, or 24-hour) for 10 weeks before being transplanted to larger containers and grown under natural daylength until flowering. Providing Echinacea hybrid cultivars with a 16-hour photoperiod during liner production resulted in plants which flowered soonest without negative effects on growth.

This is especially true for novice programmers and the non-technical-savvy masses that are largely precluded from enjoying the advantages of high-performance computing. Moreover, different groups within the heterogeneous computing community (e.g., hardware architects, tool developers, and programmers) are presented with new challenges with respect to performance, programmability, and portability (or the three P's) of heterogeneous computing.   In this work we discuss such challenges and identify benchmarking techniques based on computation and communication patterns as an appropriate means for the systematic evaluation of heterogeneous computing with respect to the three P's. Our proposed approach is based on OpenCL implementations of the Berkeley dwarfs. We use our benchmark suite (OpenDwarfs) in characterizing performance of state-of-the-art parallel architectures, and as the main component of a methodology (Telescoping Architectures) for identifying trends in future heterogeneous architectures. Furthermore, we employ OpenDwarfs in a multi-faceted study on the gaps between the three P's in the context of the modern heterogeneous computing landscape. Our case-study spans a variety of compilers, languages, optimizations, and target architectures, including the CPU, GPU, MIC, and FPGA. Based on our insights, and extending aspects of prior research (e.g., in compilers, programming languages, and auto-tuning), we propose the introduction of grid-based data structures as the basis of programming frameworks and present a prototype unified framework (GLAF) that encompasses a novel visual programming environment with code generation, auto-parallelization, and auto-tuning capabilities. Our results, which span scientific domains, indicate that our holistic approach constitutes a viable alternative towards enhancing the three P's and further democratizing heterogeneous, parallel computing for non-programming-savvy audiences, and especially domain scientists.\",","4881":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4882":"\"description-provenance\": [","4883":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-04T08:00:41Z (GMT).

People use their prospective memory to remember future to-do tasks. However, the current design of LBRs fails to take advantage of human prospective memory theory. In this dissertation, I propose a framework connecting human prospective memory theory with LBRs. My work applies human prospective memory into the technical design of LBRs. The goal of my work is to make the reminder work more consistently with how human memory works.   Prospective memory research suggests that encoding of the location and familiarity with the location have an impact on prospective remembering. I conducted two empirical studies to test how this theoretical knowledge applies to LBRs. In one experiment, I hypothesized that if the encoding stage provides a closer match to the retrieval stage in LBRs, then location recognition and task recall should improve at retrieval time. The results indicate that providing a first-person view (street view of the desired location) at the encoding stage benefits prospective remembering the most.   Prospective memory theory also suggests that the familiarity with the external cue has a significant influence on prospective remembering. In the second experiment, I hypothesized that familiarity with a location has an impact on the location recognition at the retrieval. The results show that the encoding interface is used differently for familiar and unfamiliar cities and businesses to support recognizing a target location.   The findings have implications for the design of future LBRs. I designed an LBR prototype by applying these empirical research findings and conducted a usability evaluation. Future designers of LBR should consider 1) providing more support in matching the encoding stage to the eventual cue in retrieval stage and 2) involving user\u2019s familiarity level with the places at the encoding stage to provide a better user experience. My work showed the importance of using prospective memory theory in the design of LBR systems.\",","4927":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4928":"\"description-provenance\": [","4929":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-04T08:00:49Z (GMT).

Its flexibility is due to the ability of the bars to move near-independent to each other, movement that can be caused by controlled tension forces in the tendons or external forces such as gravity. However, a balance of sorts must be maintained - if a tendon were to go slack, the entire structure could become unstable and collapse on itself.  This thesis looks at placing a tensegrity structure in orbit around the Earth. As a spacecraft's orbit is moved further away from the Earth, the strength of the Earth's gravity field lessens. Ideally, such a flexible structure would be placed far enough away from the Earth so that the gravity field would have too weak an impact on its individual elements to cause major distortions. However, the author recognizes that altitudes below 2,000 km, where the Earth's gravity field is still very prevalent, are the most common altitudes used by orbiting spacecraft today. The goal of this thesis is to analyze the distortions of the tensegrity structure at these lower altitudes, and also look at methods for controlling these distortions.\",","4971":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","4972":"\"description-provenance\": [","4973":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-04T08:00:57Z (GMT).

Motivational contexts for these courses must extend beyond short-term interest to empower students and connect to learners' long-term goals, while maintaining a scaffolded experience. To solve ongoing problems such as student retention, methods should be explored that can engage and motivate students.  I propose Data Science as an introductory context that can appeal to a wide range of learners. To test this hypothesis, my work uses two educational theories \ufffd\\"- the MUSIC Model of Academic Motivation and Situated Learning Theory \ufffd\\"- to evaluate different components of a student's learning experience for their contribution to the student's motivation. I analyze existing contexts that are used in introductory computing courses, such as game design and media computation, and their limitations in regard to educational theories. I also review how Data Science has been used as a context, and its associated affordances and barriers.  Next, I describe two research projects that make it simple to integrate Data Science into introductory classes. The first project, RealTimeWeb, was a prototypical exploration of how real-time web APIs could be scaffolded into introductory projects and problems. RealTimeWeb evolved into the CORGIS Project, an extensible framework populated by a diverse collection of freely available \\"Pedagogical Datasets\\" designed specifically for novices. These datasets are available in easy-to-use libraries for multiple languages, various file formats, and also through accessible web-based tools. While developing these datasets, I identified and systematized a number of design issues, opportunities, and concepts involved in the preparation of Pedagogical Datasets.  With the completed technology, I staged a number of interventions to evaluate Data Science as an introductory context and to better understand the relationship between student motivation and course outcomes. I present findings that show evidence for the potential of a Data Science context to motivate learners. While I found evidence that the course content naturally has a stronger influence on course outcomes, the course context is a valuable component of the course's learning experience.\",","5017":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5018":"\"description-provenance\": [","5019":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-04T08:01:04Z (GMT).

This system provides incentives for administrators at institutions of higher education to make strategic accounting choices, with respect to the classification of research expenditures, to improve the prestige of the university.  I first measure the amount of accounting discretion within a university's classification of research expenditures and then test whether discretionary research expenditures impact the prestige of a university.  Results indicate that discretionary research expenditures are positively associated with university prestige.  Specifically, universities within my sample that have positive discretionary research expenditures have an increased probability of subsequently being classified as a Doctoral University with moderate to high research activity by 5% and 7% respectively.  In addition, universities within my sample that had positive discretionary research expenditures experienced increases in their ranking of federal funding received relative to other universities by an average of 20.4 positions.

Every piece of the integrated circuit (IC) is powered by a point-of-load (POL) converter, where the proximity of the power supply to the load is very critical in terms of transient performance and efficiency. A compact POL converter with high power density is desired because of current trends toward reducing the size and increasing functionalities of all forms of IT products and portable electronics. To improve the power density, a 3D integrated POL module has been successfully demonstrated at the Center for Power Electronic Systems (CPES) at Virginia Tech. While some challenges still need to be addressed, this research begins by improving the 3D integrated POL module with a reduced DCR for higher efficiency, the vertical module design for a smaller footprint occupation, and the hybrid core structure for non-linear inductance control.      Moreover, as an important category of the POL converter, the voltage regulator (VR) serves an important role in powering processors in today's electronics. The multi-core processors are widely used in almost all kinds of CPUs, ranging from the big servers in data centers to the small smartphones in almost everyone's pocket. When powering multiple processor cores, the energy consumption can be reduced dramatically if the supply voltage can be modulated rapidly based on the power demand of each core by dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). However, traditional discrete voltage regulators (VRs) are not able to realize the full potential of DVFS since they are not able to modulate the supply voltage fast enough due to their relatively low switching frequency and the high parasitic interconnect impedance between the VRs and the processors. With these discrete VRs, DVFS has only been applied at a coarse timescale, which can scale voltage levels only in tens of microseconds (which is normally called a coarse-grained DVFS). In order to get the full benefit of DVFS, a concept of an integrated voltage regulator (IVR) is proposed to allow fine-grained DVFS to scale voltage levels in less than a microsecond. Significant interest from both academia and industry has been drawn to IVR research.      Recently, Intel has implemented two generations of very high frequency IVR. The first generation is implemented in Haswell processors, where air core inductors are integrated in the processor's packaging substrate and placed very closely to the processor die. The air core inductors have very limited ability in confining the high frequency magnetic flux noise generated by the very high switching frequency of 140MHz. In the second generation IVR in Broadwell processors, the inductors are moved away from the processor substrate to the 3DL PCB modules in the motherboard level under the die.      Besides computers, small portable electronics such as smartphones are another application that can be greatly helped by IVRs. The smartphone market size is now larger than 400 billion US dollars, and its power consumption is becoming higher and higher as the functionality of smartphones continuously advances. Today's multi-phase VR for smartphone processors is built with a power management integrated circuit (PMIC) with discrete inductors. Today's smartphone VRs operate at 2-8MHz, but the discrete inductor is still bulky, and the VR is not close enough to the processor to support fine-grained DVFS. If the IVR solution can be extended to the smartphone platform, not only can the battery life be greatly improved, but the total power consumption of the smartphone (and associated charging time and charging safety issues) can also be significantly reduced. Intel's IVR may be a viable solution for computing applications, but the air core inductor with un-confined high-frequency magnetic flux would cause very severe problems for smartphones, which have even less of a space budget. This work proposes a three-dimensional (3D) integrated voltage regulator (IVR) structure for smartphone platforms. The proposed 3D IVR will operate with a frequency of tens of MHz. Instead of using an air core, a high-frequency magnetic core without an air gap is applied to confine the very high frequency flux. The inductor is designed with an ultra-low profile and a small footprint to fit the stringent space requirement of smartphones.       A major challenge in the development of the very high frequency IVR inductor is to accurately characterize and compare magnetic materials in the tens of MHz frequency range. Despite the many existing works in this area, the reported measured properties of the magnetics are still very limited and indirect. In regards to permeability, although its value at different frequencies is often reported, its saturation property in real DC-biased working conditions still lacks investigation. In terms of loss property, the previous works usually show the equivalent resistance value only, which is usually measured with small-signal excitation from an impedance/network analyzer and is not able to represent the real magnetic core loss under large-signal excitation in working conditions. The lack of magnetic properties in real working conditions in previous works is due to the significant challenges in the magnetic characterization technique at very high frequencies, and it is a major obstacle to accurately designing and testing the IVR inductors. In this research, an advanced core loss measurement method is proposed for very high frequency (tens of MHz) magnetic characterization for the IVR inductor design. The issues of and solutions for the permeability and loss measurement are demonstrated. The LTCC and NEC flake materials are characterized and compared up to 40MHz for IVR application.       Based on the characterized material properties, both single-phase and multi-phase integrated inductor are designed, fabricated and experimentally tested in 20MHz buck converters, featuring a simple single-via winding structure, small size, ultra-low profile, ultra-low DCR, high current-handling ability, air-gap-free magnetics, multi-phase integration within one magnetic core, and lateral non-uniform flux distribution. It is found that the magnetic core operates at unusually high core loss density, while it is thermally manageable. The PCB copper can effectively dissipate inductor heat with 3D integration. In addition, new GaN device drivers and magnetic materials are evaluated and demonstrated with the ability to increase the IVR frequency to 30MHz and realize a higher density with a smaller loss.       In summary, this research starts with improving the 3D integrated POL module, and then explores the use of the 3D integration technique along with the very high frequency IVR concept to power the smartphone processor. The challenges in a very high frequency magnetic characterization are addressed with a novel core loss measurement method capable of 40MHz loss characterization. The very high frequency multi-phase inductor integrated within one magnetic component is designed and demonstrated for the first time. A 20MHz IVR platform is built and the feasibility of the concept is experimentally verified. Finally, new GaN device drivers and magnetic materials are evaluated and demonstrated with the ability to increase the IVR frequency to 30MHz and realize higher density with smaller loss.\",","5159":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5160":"\"description-provenance\": [","5161":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-11T08:00:12Z (GMT).

Proper orthogonal decomposition is utilized to extract the dominant spatial structures of the system.  Within the general LES-ROM framework, two approaches are proposed to address the celebrated ROM closure problem.  No phenomenological arguments (e.g., of eddy viscosity type) are used to develop these new ROM closure models.   The first novel model is the approximate deconvolution ROM (AD-ROM), which uses methods from image processing and inverse problems to solve the ROM closure problem.  The AD-ROM is investigated in the numerical simulation of a 3D flow past a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number $Re=1000$.  The AD-ROM generates accurate results without any numerical dissipation mechanism.   It also decreases the CPU time of the standard ROM by orders of magnitude.   The second new model is the calibrated-filtered ROM (CF-ROM), which is a data-driven ROM.   The available full order model results are used offline in an optimization problem to calibrate the ROM subfilter-scale stress tensor.  The resulting CF-ROM is tested numerically in the simulation of the 1D Burgers equation with a small diffusion parameter.  The numerical results show that the CF-ROM is more efficient than and as accurate as state-of-the-art ROM closure models.\",","5206":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5207":"\"description-provenance\": [","5208":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-13T08:00:12Z (GMT).

However, surprisingly few studies of their fundamental nature at the gas-surface interface have been performed. Our research investigated sulfur mustard (HD) adsorption by characterizing interfacial hydrogen bonding and dispersion forces for the simulant molecules 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (2-CEES) and methyl salicylate on well-characterized hydroxyl-functionalized surfaces (silica and UiO-66). Our approach utilized infrared spectroscopy to study specific surface-molecule interactions and temperature-programmed desorption to measure activation energies of desorption. 2-CEES has two polar functional groups, the chloro and thioether moieties, available to accept hydrogen bonds from free surface silanol groups. Diethyl sulfide and chlorobutane were investigated to independently assess the roles of the chloro and thioester moieties in the overall adsorption mechanism and to explore the interplay between the charge transfer and electrostatic contributions to total hydrogen bond strength. The results indicate that both SiOH---Cl and SiOH---S hydrogen bonds form when 2-CEES adsorbs to silica or hydroxylated UiO-66. However, a more stable configuration in which both polar groups interact simultaneously with adjacent silanol groups likely does not form. A systemaic study of chloroalkanes revealed that dispersion forces involving the methylene units in 2-CEES contribute to nearly half of the total activation energy for desorption from silica. Methyl salicylate possesses aromatic, hydroxyl, and ester functional groups, each of which is a potential hydrogen bond acceptor. We found that uptake on silica is mainly driven by the formation of carbonyl-silanol and hydroxyl-silanol hydrogen bonds with additional contributions from weaker interactions. In an effort to learn more about the SiOH---\u03c0 bond, the adsorption of simple substituted benzene derivatives on silica was investigated to probe the effects of electron withdrawing and donating substituents. Results indicate that the substituted benzene derivatives adsorb to silica via a cooperative effect involving SiOH---\u03c0 hydrogen bonds and additional substituent-surface interactions. The strength of the SiOH---\u03c0 bond is enhanced by electron donating groups and weakened by electron withdrawing groups.\",","5254":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5255":"\"description-provenance\": [","5256":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-16T08:00:34Z (GMT).

The infrequent occurrence of significant earthquakes in the CEUS limits the necessary observations needed to understand earthquake processes and to reduce uncertainty in seismic-hazard maps. The well-recored aftershock sequence of the 2011 Mineral, Virginia, earthquake offers a rare opportunity to improve our understanding of earthquake processes and earthquake hazard in this populous region of the United States. Moreover, the rapid increase of seismicity in the CEUS since 2009 that has been linked to wastewater injection has raised concern regarding the potential hazard. In this dissertation, I first present a detailed study of the aftershock sequence of the 2011 Mw 5.7 Mineral, Virginia earthquake. It involves the hypocenter locations of ~3000 earthquakes, ~400 focal mechanism solutions, statistics of the aftershock sequence, and the Coulomb stress modeling that explains the triggering mechnanism of those aftershocks. Second, I examine the S-wave attenuation at critical short hypocentral distances (< 60 km) using the aftershock data. The observed S-wave amplitudes decay as a function of hypocenter distance R according to R^-1.3 - R^-1.5, which is substantially steeper than R^-1 for a homogeneous whole space. Finally, I propose and apply a stable multi-window coda spectral ratio method to estimate corner frequencies and Brune-type stress drops for the 2011 Mineral, Virginia mainshock and aftershocks, as well as induced earthquakes in Oklahoma. The goal of this comparative study is to find out whether or not there are systematical differences in source parameters between tectonic earthquakes and induced earthquakes in the CEUS. I found generally much higher stress drops for the Mineral, Virginia sequence. However, the stress drops for those induced earthquakes in Oklahoma exhibit large varation among individual earthquake sequences, with the large mainshocks having high stress drops (20-30 MPa, Brune-type) except for the 2011 Mw 5.6 Prague, Oklahoma earthquake. And spatially varying stress drops indicates strong fault heterogeneity, which in the case of induced earthquakes may be influenced by the injection of fluids into the subsurface.\",","5301":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5302":"\"description-provenance\": [","5303":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-17T08:00:17Z (GMT).

Furthermore, decades of research has shown relationships between climate, tectonics, and surface processes in most orogens across the globe (e.g. Alps, Himalaya, Andes, Alaska Ranges), however the role climate plays in modulating erosion and mass fluxes from extensional mountains blocks to sedimentary basins over 104-5 yr timescales is debated. In the eastern California-Walker Lane shear zone, exposures of sedimentary basin fill allow inversion of erosion- and sediment-flux rates from a linked catchment-fan system within an extensional block. In this dissertation, I present two field and geo-thermochronology based studies that explore research topics related by common tectonic setting and geography within the Pacific-North America plate boundary. First I present new low-temperature thermochronology (apatite U-Th-Sm/He) and thermal history modeling to document the kinematic evolution of the Santa Rosa mountains, where the cooling history constrains initiation timing of the west Salton Detachment fault, and the southern San Andreas fault system. I document an age of ca. 8 Ma for exhumation initiation of the Santa Rosa block, from paleodepths of ~4.5\ufffd\\"3 km, at vertical rates of ~0.15\ufffd\\"0.36 mm/yr, accelerating to ~1.3 km/Ma since ca. 1.2 Ma during initiation of the San Jacinto fault zone. Second, I present a new data set of cosmogenic radionuclide-derived burial ages and paleodenudation rates (26Al/10Be) from the Pleasant Canyon complex in the Panamint Range, and show that denudation rate and sediment flux have varied by a factor of ~2x since the middle Pleistocene. I conclude high frequency variability is driven by climate change, and not tectonic perturbations, as supported by published constraints for exhumation timing. The middle Pleistocene transition from 40\ufffd\\"100 ka periodicity may drive the observed changes, a tentative conclusion that makes testable predictions for stratigraphic records of past climate in other locations. Empirical evidence for climate-modulated erosion and sediment flux provides valuable constraints for numerical models of landscape evolution and sedimentary basin architecture.\",","5347":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5348":"\"description-provenance\": [","5349":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-20T08:00:20Z (GMT).

In the studies presented in this dissertation, we used advanced echocardiographic techniques to elucidate several aspects of MMVD in dogs. Our hypothesis was that the mitral valve (MV) morphology could have a role in the development of MMVD. First, we tested whether we could use real time three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (RT-3DTTE), and an offline software for MV analysis to evaluate canine MV. We described that the technique was feasible and repeatable, we evaluated the morphology of the MV in healthy dogs, and we provided reference values for MV morphologic variables in this species. Then, we used the same technique to compare healthy dogs to dogs affected by MMVD. We found that dogs affected by MMVD have more circular and flatter valve. We then analyzed the MV of healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs), given the high predisposition of this breed for MMVD. Our findings indicate that compared to healthy dogs of other breeds, the MV of healthy CKCSs is flatter and has less leaflet tenting, corroborating our hypothesis that an altered MV morphology could represent a predisposing factor for disease development. We also used RT\ufffd\\" 3DTTE to characterize the area of the regurgitant MV orifice of dogs affected with MMVD, finding that the technique requires further standardization in order to become clinically useful. The elevation of pulmonary venous pressure caused by MMVD can, in some dogs, cause pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH), which is a risk factor associated with worse outcome in dogs with MMVD. Diagnosis of PH in dogs with MMVD is usually made by estimating pulmonary pressure using Doppler echocardiography. We are currently evaluating the accuracy of this technique, compared to invasive measurement of pulmonary pressure. Only preliminary data are presented regarding this study, as the disclosure of the blinding would have infringed the power of the study. Our preliminary results demonstrate that there is only moderate agreement between the two techniques, indicating that caution should be used when deriving the non-invasive estimation of systolic pulmonary pressure in order to make clinical decisions.\",","5394":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5395":"\"description-provenance\": [","5396":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-24T08:00:27Z (GMT).

For each of these diseases, we are working to develop superior soybean germplasm that is resistant to the devastating economic impacts of pathogens. The majority of this research is focused on screening for novel sources of P. sojae resistance with core effectors to identify resistance genes (R-genes) that will be durable under field conditions. Four segregating populations and two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations have been screened with core effectors. Effector-based screening methods were combined with pathogen-based phenotyping in the form of a mycelium-based trifoliate screening assay. One RIL population has been screened with virulent P. sojae mycelium. Disease phenotyping has generated a preliminary genetic map for resistance in soybean accession PI408132. The identification of novel R-genes will allow for stacking of resistance loci into elite G. max cultivars. The second project covered in this dissertation describes the validation of the SMV resistance gene Rsv3. Utilizing a combination of transient expression and homology modeling; we provide evidence that Glyma14g38533 encodes Rsv3.\",","5438":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5439":"\"description-provenance\": [","5440":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-25T08:00:21Z (GMT).

It is only recently that scholars have seriously considered the role of normative orders in institutional dynamics. Two meta-theories of institutionalism offer competing visions of how these normative orders are invoked. The Institutional Logics Perspective calls normative orders \u201cinstitutional logics\u201d and suggest that they are invoked in a consistent stable fashion. The Pragmatist Institutionalism approach calls normative orders \u201canchoring concepts\u201d and suggests that they are used in less predictable ways to produce meaning. This study introduces the concept of fidelity to capture the difference between these two approaches and test which approach may offer a more accurate account of how normative orders are invoked in practice. The study uses the case of the USCG response to melting Arctic ice to study this issue by focusing on the two most dominant normative orders of American government. The study relies on interviews conducted with USCG personnel dealing with the agency\u2019s response to melting Artic Ice. The data is then analyzed through a narrative analysis framework. The study finds that normative orders are invoked, in this case, in a manner more closely aligned with Pragmatist Institutionalism.

The advancement of sensing technologies has brought a data rich environment for manufacturing and provide a great opportunity for real-time, proactive quality assurance. However, due to the lack of methods for analyzing heterogeneous types of data, the transformation of data to information and knowledge for effective decision making in manufacturing is still a challenging problem. In particular, functional variables can represent the in situ process conditions and rich product performance information, and are widely encountered in various manufacturing processes. In this dissertation, I will focus on modeling of manufacturing processes with in situ process (functional) variables, and integrating these functional variables and other measured variables for the manufacturing modeling.  The modeling is explored by extracting informative features through the integration of multiple functional variables, functional variables and offline setting variables, and quantitative and qualitative quality variables. After an introduction in Chapter 1, three research tasks are investigated. First, a functional variable selection problem is studied in Chapter 2 to identify the significant functional variables as well as their features in a logistic regression model. A hierarchical non-negative garrote constrained estimation method is proposed. Second, the quality-process relationships for scalar offline setting variables, functional in situ process variables, and manufacturing quality responses are studied in Chapter 3. A functional graphical model that can integrate functional variables in a graphical model is proposed and investigated. Third, the quantitative and qualitative quality responses are jointly modeled with scalar offline setting variables and functional in situ process variables in Chapter 4. A functional quantitative and qualitative model is proposed and investigated. Finally, I summarize the research contribution and discuss future research directions in Chapter 5. The proposed methodologies have broad applications in manufacturing processes with functional variables, and are demonstrated in a crystal growth process with multiple functional variables (Chapter 2), a plasma spray process with multiple scalar and functional variables (Chapter 3), and an additive manufacturing process called fused deposition modeling with quantitative and qualitative quality responses (Chapter 4).\",","5576":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5577":"\"description-provenance\": [","5578":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-02T08:00:21Z (GMT).

In order to provide useful information for coastal protection, one of my aims in this dissertation is to identify the physical metrics that better represent the damage cause by tsunamis. I approach this problem by carrying out three-dimensional-SPH numerical simulations of solitary waves which allow to track spatial-temporal evolution of physical variables during their breaking. By comparing these evolutions it is possible to visualize the complex hydrodynamic process that occurs during breaking. Results show that the highest danger lies in the environment of the shoreline. However the highest vulnerability of coastal communities and infrastructures lies onshore where they find themselves more exposed to the destructive capacity of extreme tsunami waves. In this regard, the second main goal in this dissertation is to understand how coastal vegetation reduces and modifies the onshore wave inundation. I address this problem by using shallow water equations and Serre-Green-Naghdi equations employed in a set of two-dimensional depth-integrated simulations. Analysis of results indicate the existence of a transition zone located between where runup is not affected at all and where runup suffers the maximum reduction by the vegetation. This infers the requirement of a minimum length of the vegetated barrier in order to achieve the maximum runup reduction under a specific set properties such as barrier location, barrier width, beach slope and/or wave amplitude. Overall we conclude, after intense validation work, that numerical approaches are very convenient tools to analyze difficult wave processes. However it is necessary to be aware of the limitation of each numerical approach.\",","5621":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5622":"\"description-provenance\": [","5623":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-03T08:00:15Z (GMT).

Electromagnetic responses resulting from the subsurface diffusion of applied electromagnetic fields through heterogeneous geoelectrical structures are utilized to characterize the underlying geology. Geology exhibits multiscale hierarchical structure which brought about by almost all geological processes operating across multiple length scales and the relationship between multiscale electrical properties of underlying geology and the observed electromagnetic response has not yet been fully understood. To quantify this relationship, the electromagnetic responses of textured and spatially correlated, stochastic geologic media are herein presented. The modelling results demonstrate that the resulting electromagnetic responses present a power law distribution, rather than a smooth response polluted with random, incoherent noise as commonly assumed; moreover, they are examples of fractional Brownian motion. Furthermore, the results indicate that the fractal behavior of electromagnetic responses is correlated with the degree of the spatial correlation, the contrasts in ground electrical conductivity, and the preferred orientation of small-scale heterogeneity. In addition, these inferences are also supported by the observed electromagnetic responses from a fault zone comprising different lithological units and varying wavelengths of geologic heterogeneity.   Seismic signals generated by aftershocks are generally recorded by local aftershock networks consisted of insufficient number of stations which result in strongly spatially-aliased aftershock data. This limits aftershock detections and locations at smaller magnitudes. Following the 23 August 2011 Mineral, Virginia earthquake, to drastically reduce spatial aliasing, a temporary dense array (AIDA) consisting of ~200 stations at 200-400 m spacing was deployed near the epicenter to record the 12 days of the aftershocks. The backprojection imaging method is applied to the entire AIDA dataset to detect and locate aftershocks. The method takes advantage of staking of many seismograms and improves the signal-to-noise ratio for detection. The catalog obtained from the co-deployed, unusually large temporal traditional network of 36 stations enabled a quantitative comparison. The aftershock catalog derived from the dense AIDA array and the backprojection indicates event detection an order of magnitude smaller including events as small as M\ufffd\\"1.8. The catalog is complete to magnitude \ufffd\\"1.0 while the traditional network catalog was complete to M\ufffd\\"0.27 for the same time period. The AIDA backprojection catalog indicate the same major patterns of seismicity in the epicentral region, but additional details are revealed indicating a more complex fault zone and a new shallow cluster. The b-value or the temporal decay constant were not changed by inclusion of the small events; however, they are different for two completeness periods and are different at shallow depth than greater depth.\",","5666":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5667":"\"description-provenance\": [","5668":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-05T08:00:23Z (GMT).

Most researchers agree that eliminating poverty requires a holistic approach that is attentive to promoting pro-poor growth, creating opportunities for employment, ensuring that the fruits of growth reach impoverished communities, and protecting vulnerable segments of the impoverished population. This study looks the role of microcredits, which has received increasing attention as a means to combat poverty.  The advent of neoliberalism led to advances in autonomous markets, commodification, market-led growth, and the dissolution of the Keynesian welfare state. Microcredit growing out of a neoliberal shift plays a powerful role as an instrument to fight poverty, especially in the age government and state failure, entrepreneurial expansion and self-employment income-earing opportunities. Microcredit programs are of great interest to governments, non-governmental organization, and banks because of their potential for reducing poverty. Critics of the microcredit movement argue that microcredit does little besides replacing existing informal credit arrangements to fund subsistence activity, which they view as having little or no prospect of growth. They argue that support of microcredit may over anticipate its benefits, such as the alleviation of poverty and female empowerment.  This study assesses the effectiveness of microcredit combined asset building as a pro-growth approach to reduce poverty sustainably in Kinshasa. The recent crises of over-indebtedness in several markets and Kinshasa have fueled growing concern that microcredit may be getting borrowers into trouble. However, my study findings show that assets, specifically microcredit, can stem the poverty cycle and better enable individuals to \\"stand on their own two feet\\"socio-economically if combined with other innovative programs. This study uses the test of significance to assess the effectiveness microcredit integrated asset building.\",","5712":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5713":"\"description-provenance\": [","5714":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-06T08:00:27Z (GMT).

Granulites are ubiquitous in exhumed Archean cratons and are thought to comprise much of Earth's stable lower crust. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for crustal heating in Archean terranes is thus paramount to understanding the stabilisation of early continental crust, and whether such mechanisms resemble modern tectonic processes. It is therefore important to quantify the pressure\ufffd\\"temperature\ufffd\\"time (P\ufffd\\"T\ufffd\\"t) paths of Archean granulites, as such paths can be diagnostic of heating mechanism. This dissertation explores1) novel approaches to reconstructing the P\ufffd\\"T\ufffd\\"t paths of granulites, and 2) what the deciphered P\ufffd\\"T\ufffd\\"t paths of rocks from two Archean granulite terranes reveal about Archean crustal heating. The first chapter shows how petrologic modelling at multiple scales from a texturally heterogeneous granulite can provide \\"snapshots\\" of the P\ufffd\\"T path, which would be difficult to reconstruct otherwise. The remaining chapters are focused on reconstructing the P\ufffd\\"T\ufffd\\"t paths of two Archean granulite terranesthe Beartooth Mountains, and the Pikwitonei granulite domain (PGD). The second and third chapters present evidence for cryptic HT metamorphism of the Beartooth granulites at ~2.7 Ga characterized by rapid (< 1 Ma) exhumation at HT and fast cooling (~10-100 C/Ma) in the middle crust. This suggests advective/conductive heating over short length-scales. In the fourth chapter, thermobarometric data suggest the western PGD experienced UHT decompression followed by cooling in the lower crust. High-precision zircon and monazite dates reveal apparently episodic crystallization over at least ~24 Ma. This episodicity could reflect multiple thermal cycles or the control of local reactions on zircon/monazite crystallization during cooling. High-spatial resolution petrochronology provides temporal constraints on prograde metamorphism. These data suggest metamorphism in the PGD was driven by a long-lived heat source over large length-scales near the base of the lithosphere. Disparities in the timescales, length-scales, and the depth and amount of heating between the terranes may suggest different crustal heating mechanisms in each, and that the late Archean Earth may have been tectonically diverse.\",","5758":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5759":"\"description-provenance\": [","5760":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-06T08:00:48Z (GMT).

This dissertation offers a new version of the approach, rejecting many of its ideological commitments to liberal-democratic humanism and replacing them with more distinctly collectivist and communitarian ones. It contends that the capability approach, when used as a theoretical framework for global development, need not contain almost any ethical normativity with regard to a definition of justice, and indeed it is much more functional when it endorses a moderate ethical relativism. The argument proceeds in four steps. First, it shows that all existing versions of the capability approach are ideologically committed to a specific kind of liberal humanism, which its proponents consider universalist but that is actually quite provincial. Second, it argues that collectivist critiques from prominent capability theorists in the last decade have been misunderstood and their recommendations unheeded, a fact that this dissertation attempts to rectify. Third, it offers a properly collectivist account of group capabilities and group self-determination, which can do all the normative work that individual capabilities and agency perform in the approach's original versions. Finally, it introduces the notion of public objective capabilities, which justifies a higher deference to collective self-determination at the expense of some individual freedom and equitable participation in democratic polity. The overall goal of this new collectivist version of the approach is not to reject the worth of capability as a metric of global justice, but rather to reinforce it. A collectivist capabilitarianism shows that capability is so well suited to global development work that it can function across diverse political realities, without the ideological constraints of a liberal humanism that is widely accepted in the Global North but whose cross-cultural appeal has been far overstated by its proponents.\",","5802":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5803":"\"description-provenance\": [","5804":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-06T08:00:54Z (GMT).

These approaches require the identification of candidate genes to uptake, transport and store Fe in potato tubers. We employed multiple approaches including SNP genotyping, QTL analysis, identifying genes orthologous to Arabidopsis ferrome, yeast complementation assay and genetic transformation to avoid the limitation from a single approach. We revealed several candidate genes potentially associated with potato plant Fe acquisition, PGSC0003DMG400024976 (metal transporter), PGSC0003DMG400013297 (oligopeptide transporter), PGSC0003DMG400021155 (IRT1) and IRTunannotated (an ortholog to the IRT gene that is not annotated in the potato genome). The microorganisms in the rhizosphere react intensely with the various metabolites released by plant roots in a variety of ways such as positive, negative, and neutral. These interactions can influence the uptake and transport of micronutrients in the plant roots. Therefore, the contribution of soil microorganisms in the rhizosphere to improve Fe supply of plants may play a key role in Fe biofortification, especially under real world field-based soil scenarios. We thus investigated rhizosphere microbial community diversity in Andean potato landraces to understand the role of plant-microbial interaction in potato Fe nutrient cycling. From the analysis of the high-throughput Illumina sequences of 16S and ITS region of ribosomal RNA gene, we found that both potato landraces with low and high Fe content in tubers and a landrace on which low or high Fe content fertilizer was applied to the leaf surface had large impacts on the rhizosphere fungal community composition. Indicator species analysis (ISA) indicated that Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) contributing most to these impacts were closely related to Eurotiomycetes and Leotiomycetes in the phylum Ascomycota, Glomeromycetes in the phylum Glomeromycota and Microbotryomycetes in the phylum Basidiomycota. Lots of species from these groups have been shown to regulate plant mineral nutrient cycling. Our research revealed potential candidate genes and fungal taxa involved in the potato plant Fe nutrient dynamics, which provides new insights into crop management and breeding strategies for sustainable Fe fortification in agricultural production.\",","5851":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5852":"\"description-provenance\": [","5853":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-06T08:01:01Z (GMT).

In the process of producing a library of compounds for assay against An. gambiae, it became clear that employing regioselective acylation techniques (in molecules that feature two nucleophilic, acyclic nitrogen atoms \u03b1 to one another) would be imperative. Synthesis of the library derivatives proceeded rapidly and after topical assay, we found three compounds that were more toxic than the RH-series leads. One of the three displayed an LD50 value of half that of RH-1266, though patch clamp assay concluded that toxicity was not necessarily linked to inhibition of mosquito K+ channel Kv2.1. \tThe acylation of monoarylhydrazines appears simple, but its regioselectivity is poorly understood when assumed as a function of basicity correlating to nucleophilic strength. We determined the ratio of the rate constants for distal to proximal N-acylation using 19F NMR spectroscopic analysis of reactions of 4-fluorophenylhydrazine with limiting (0.2 equiv) acylating agent in the presence of various bases. Acid anhydrides gave consistent preference for distal acylation. The selectivity of acylation by acyl chlorides when using pyridine gives strong distal preference, whereas use of triethylamine or aqueous base in conjunction with aroyl chlorides showed a moderate preference for proximal acylation. This observation yielded a convenient one-step method to synthesize proximal aroylarylhydrazines in yields comparable or superior to that provided by the standard three-step literature approach. Combined with NMR evidence of the distal nitrogen as the unambigiously stronger base of the two nitrogens, we propose a single electron transfer mechanism that predicts the regiochemistry of arylhydrazines toward acylating agents better than the nucleophilicity model based on pKa values. \tWhile synthesizing the acylhydrazine library for assay against An. gambiae, NMR spectroscopy revealed rotational isomerisms of two typeschiral helicity (M)/(P) and acyl (E)/(Z)-isomerism due to hindered rotation. Variable temperature NMR allowed the measurement of N-N bond rotational barriers, as well as estimate the barrier of (E)/(Z) interconversion. We obtained the X-ray crystal structures of four diacylhydrazines to test this hypothesis and revealed both the twist conformation around the N-N bond axis and (E)/(Z)-isomerism around the proximal acyl group. Computation (which agreed with the crystal structures) allowed us to estimate which (E)/(Z)-isomers were most likely being observed in solution at room temperature by NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we were able to calculate transition structures corresponding to N-N bond rotational barriers of (E,Z)- and (Z,Z)-isomers of model molecules and rationalize the difference in coalescence temperatures between (E,Z)- and (Z,Z)-isomers.\",","5900":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","5901":"\"description-provenance\": [","5902":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-06T08:01:08Z (GMT).

How do they negotiate their gender-role expectations and actual practices at work and home?

Finally, these findings show that in some academic fields, being women may place obstacles for career advancement, but that co-ethnic network provides alternative opportunities for them and can lead to greater research productivity.

Constraints arise in three ways.  First, possible new theoretical frameworks are reviewed and analyzed for the compatibility with collider experiments.  We study alternate theories such as the superconnection formalism and non-commutative geometry (NCG) and show how these can be put to test, if any collider excess were to show up. In this case, we use the previous diboson and diphoton statistical excess as examples to do the analysis.  Second, we parametrize low energy new physics in the neutrino sector in terms of non-standard interactions (NSI), which are constrained by past and proposed future neutrino experiments. As an example, we show the capability of resolving such NSI with the OscSNS, a detector proposed for Oak Ridge National Lab and derive interesting new constraints on NSI at very low energy ($\\lesssim$ 50 MeV). Apart from this, in order to better understand the NSI matter effect in long baseline experiments such as the future DUNE experiment, we derive a new compact formula to describe the effect analytically, which provides a clear physical picture of our understanding of the NSI matter effect compared to numerical computations.  Last, we discuss the possibility of combining neutrino and collider data to get a better understanding of where the new physics is hidden.  In particular, we study a model that produces sizable NSI to show how they can be constrained by past collider data, which covers a distinct region of the model parameter space from the DUNE experiment. In combining the two, we show that neutrino experiments are complementary to collider searches in ruling out models such as the ones that utilize a light mediator particle. More general procedures in constructing such models relevant to neutrino experiments are also described.\",","6047":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6048":"\"description-provenance\": [","6049":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:00:30Z (GMT).

For those who do, what occurs during engagement in anarchy?  By collecting the oral histories of anarchistic activists, this study indicates how crises, personal and collective, is a not only a motivating factor for why individuals join and engage in anarchistic movements and spaces, but how crises are, in turn, radically transformed through engagement in anarchical practice.  To understand this process, this study explores crises through the development of an eco-anarchistic dialectical framework--negate-subvert-create--to indicate how the crises of capital are embodied, consciously negated, subverted politically, and ultimately transformed through engagement in anarchy.  Anarchy is accordingly conceptualized as a liminal spatio-temporality that allows individuals to reconnect their selves to their potentials to become something beyond the ecological destructive and dominant social world.  These potential are realized through the embodiment of communitas, or collective liminality--a natural communality that individuals reconnect to engaging in anarchy.  I end with an exploration of the possible outcomes and potential futures of anarchy by situating the current political, economic, social and ecological crises occurring around the globe within the eco-anarchistic framework developed in this study.  Here, I indicate the importance of engaging in care practices and creating care-networks as a necessary outcome and future political practice for anarchistic movements as a way to mitigate and ultimately transform the crises of capital.\",","6091":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6092":"\"description-provenance\": [","6093":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:00:44Z (GMT).

The most important mycotoxin in the U.S. is deoxynivalenol (DON), which causes symptoms such as vomiting, feed refusal, and weight loss in farm animals. The fungus Fusarium graminearum produces DON in staple crops such as wheat, barley, and corn. It is estimated that the economic losses associated with DON contamination alone exceed $650 million per year in the U.S. New strategies are needed to mitigate DON and improve food safety in the U.S. The overall goal of my research is to discover and employ microorganisms and enzymes to detoxify DON. The specific objectives are to(1) discover and characterize microorganisms that detoxify DON, (2) use a cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) system to study enzymes that modify DON, (3) engineer yeast to detoxify DON with a metabolic engineering strategy, and (4) deliver a high school unit to teach high school students about mycotoxins in food. In Objective 1, two mixed cultures were identified from environmental samples that converted DON into the less toxic 3-keto-deoxynivalenol (3-keto-DON). In Objective 2, a CFPS system was used to express three known acetyltransferase genes to convert DON to 3-acetyl-DON (3-A-DON). In Objective 3, we identified a potential DON transporter from a library of randomly amplified fragments from the genomes of mixed cultures of microbes isolated from the environment. In Objective 4, we developed and delivered a unique high school unit to educate high school students about potential mycotoxins in food and feed products.

Also, the snakes assume an S-like posture and start to undulate by sending traveling waves down the body. The present study aims to answer how the snakes are able to control their glide trajectory and remain stable without any specialized flight surfaces. Undulation is the most prominent behavior of flying snakes and is likely to influence their dynamics and stability. To examine the effects of undulation, a number of theoretical models were used. First, only the longitudinal dynamics were considered with simple two-dimensional models, in which the snake was approximated as a number of connected airfoils. Previously measured force coefficients were used to model aerodynamic forces, and undulation was considered as periodic changes in the mass and area of the airfoils. The model was shown to be passively unstable, but it could be stabilized with a restoring pitching moment. Next, a three-dimensional model was developed, with the snake modeled as a chain of airfoils connected through revolute joints, and undulation was considered as periodic changes in the joint angles. It was shown that undulation, when added to a linearization-based closed-loop control, could increase the size of the basin of stability. Our theoretical results suggested that the snakes need some extent of closed-loop control in spite of the clear contribution of undulation to the stability of glide. Next, we considered the effects of aerodynamic interactions between the fore and the aft body on the aerodynamic performance of flying snakes. Two-dimensional anatomically accurate airfoils were used in a water tunnel. Lift and drag forces were measured by load cells, and the flow field data were obtained using digital particle image velocimetry. The results confirmed strong dependence of the aerodynamic performance on the tandem arrangement. Flow fields around the airfoils were obtained to show how the tandem arrangement modified the separated flow and the wake; therefore altering the pressure field and resulting in changes in the lift and drag.\",","6188":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6189":"\"description-provenance\": [","6190":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:02:04Z (GMT).

This is due to the ingestion of Se-hyperaccumulating vegetation growing on previously reclaimed phosphate mine soils. A field-scale analysis was first conducted to examine Se bioavailability to plants. Soil and plant samples were collected from transects from five study locations in Soda Springs, Idaho. Soils were analyzed for Se speciation and geochemical phases using a sequential extraction procedure (SEP). Additionally, speciation, SEP results, and Se bioavailability in the hyperaccumulator, western aster (Symphyotrichum ascendens (Lindl.)), were related using simple linear regression. Soil speciation and the validity of this SEP were then evaluated using synchrotron-sourced X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy for both whole and a sequence of extracted soils. Lastly, competitive adsorption of Se with two dissolved organic carbon (DOC) species, citric and salicylic acid, was examined on an amorphous iron oxide mineral surface.  A strong relationship was identified for western aster Se and the first two combined SEP fractions, water-soluble and PO43--extractable Se (R2 = 0.85; P = <0.0001). Results also indicated a strong relationship between selenate and water-soluble Se (R2 = 0.83; P = 0.0002). This suggests that water extracts could be useful Se bioavailability assessment tools in highly contaminated systems. XAFS analyses indicated that elemental and organic Se were the most predominant phases overall in whole soils. The dominant oxidized species present was selenite sorbed onto iron oxides and calcite. Critical SEP evaluations using XAFS also indicate that oxidized Se species were underestimated by the SEP and elemental Se was overestimated. In extracted soils, XAFS results indicated partial recovery of carbonate, iron oxide and organic Se occurred. Therefore, it is suggested that researchers exert caution when employing SEPs. Additionally, sorption analyses demonstrated the highly competitive behavior of citric acid with both selenite (pH 5-8) and selenate (pH 5-6). Little competition was observed in the presence of salicylic acid for both Se species. Competition and subsequent desorption of both sorbed species in the presence of citric acid suggest a possible mechanism for Se solubilization and bioavailability in seleniferous environments.\",","6280":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6281":"\"description-provenance\": [","6282":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-08T08:00:32Z (GMT).

Due to these redundancies, inherent variations exist in human movement, called motor variability (MV). Current evidence suggests that MV can be beneficial, and that there is an inverse association between MV and risk of injury. To better understand how the CNS manipulates MV to reduce injury risks, we investigated the effects of individual differences, task-relevant aspects, and psychological factors as modifiers of MV. Earlier work found that experienced workers adapted more stable movements than novices in repetitive lifting tasks. To expand on this, we quantified how MV differs between experienced workers and novices in different lifting conditions (i.e., lifting asymmetry and fatigue). Three different measures (cycle-to-cycle SD, sample entropy, and the goal equivalent manifold) were used to quantify MV. In a symmetric lifting task, experienced workers had more constrained movement than novices, and experienced workers exhibited more consistent behavior in the asymmetric condition. Novices constrained their movements, and could not maintain the same level of variability in the asymmetric condition. We concluded that experienced workers adapt stable or flexible strategies depending on task difficulty. In a prolonged lifting task, both groups increased their MV to adapt to fatigue; they particularly increased variability in a direction that had no effects on their main task goal. Developing fatigue also makes it difficult for individuals maintain the main goal. Based on these results, we conclude that increasing variability is an adaptive strategy in response to fatigue. We also assessed variability in gait parameters to compare gait adaptability using a head-worn display (HWD) compared with head-down displays for visual information presentation. An effective strategy we observed for performing a cognitive task successfully during walking was to increase gait variability in the goal direction. In addition, we found that head-up walking had smaller effects on MV, suggesting that HWDs are a promising technology to reduce adverse events during gait (e.g., falls). In summary, these results suggest that MV can be a useful indicator for evaluating some occupational injury risks.\",","6327":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6328":"\"description-provenance\": [","6329":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-08T08:00:47Z (GMT).

Carriere and Carolina hemlock Tsuga caroliniana Englem. in the eastern United States.  A newly reported beetle predator for HWA, Scymnus (Pullus) coniferarum Crotch (ColeopteraCocinellidae) preys on the pest in the western United States, and was approved for release in the eastern United States for the control of HWA.  This research investigated the viability of S. coniferarum as a biological control agent of A. tsugae in the eastern United States, as well as the ecological dynamics between S. coniferarum and host prey species in its native range of western North America.   In objective one, S. coniferarum predation, reproductive potential, and survival were evaluated in field-cages on adelgid infested T. canadensis in southwestern Virginia. Adult S. coniferarum fed on both generations and all life stages of A. tsugae at rates comparable to other adelgid-specific predators, and survived for extended periods of time in the field.  In objective two, host-range tests for S. coniferarum were conducted in a series of no-choice and paired-choice feeding, oviposition, and development studies.  Scymnus coniferarum adults fed on all adelgid species, and completed development on HWA and Adelges piceae Ratz.  Scymmnus coniferarum oviposition was extremely low.  In the final objective, Douglas-fir, Pseudotusga menziesii Mirb., Shore pine, Pinus contorta Dougl., western white pine, Pinus monticola Dougl., and western hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. host tree species were sampled in Tacoma, Washington to investigate the life history of S. coniferarum and associated adelgid prey species in the western United States.  Scymnus coniferarum adults were found on both pine species, Douglas fir, and western hemlock, and seemed to move between host tree species seasonally. Each host tree supports a different adelgid species, and a limited diet of strictly HWA in host-range tests could have contributed to low oviposition rates.   This study suggested that S. coniferarum is a voracious predator of HWA in the field and laboratory.  However, S. coniferarum laid very few eggs in laboratory studies, and zero eggs were recovered in field-cage analyses.  This suggested that S. coniferarum may rely on multiple adelgid species to reproduce and establish in the eastern United States.\",","6421":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6422":"\"description-provenance\": [","6423":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-08T08:01:08Z (GMT).

The emerging wide-band-gap (WBG) material based power semiconductor devices are considered as gaming changing devices which can exceed the limit of silicon (Si) and be used to pursue groundbreaking high-frequency, high-efficiency, and high-power-density power conversion.   The switching performance of cascode GaN HEMT is studied at first. An accurate behavior-level simulation model is developed with comprehensive consideration of the impacts of parasitics. Then based on the simulation model, detailed loss breakdown and loss mechanism analysis are studied. The cascode GaN HEMT has high turn-on loss due to the reverse recovery charge and junction capacitor charge, and the common source inductance (CSI) of the package; while the turn-off loss is extremely small attributing to unique current source turn off mechanism of the cascode structure.   With this unique feature, the critical conduction mode (CRM) soft switching technique is applied to reduce the dominant turn on loss and significantly increase converter efficiency. The switching frequency is successfully pushed to 5MHz while maintaining high efficiency and good thermal performance.   Traditional packaging method is becoming a bottle neck to fully utilize the advantages of GaN HEMT. So an investigation of the package influence on the cascode GaN HEMT is also conducted. Several critical parasitic inductance are identified, which cause high turn on loss and high parasitic ringing that may lead to device failure. To solve the issue, the stack-die package is proposed to eliminate all critical parasitic inductance, and as a result, reducing turn on loss by half and avoiding potential failure mode of the cascode GaN device effectively.   Utilizing soft switching and enhanced packaging, a GaN-based MHz totem-pole PFC rectifier is demonstrated with 99% peak efficiency and 700 W/in3 power density. The switching frequency of the PFC is more than ten times higher than the state-of-the-art industry product while it achieves best possible efficiency and power density. Integrated power module and integrated PCB winding coupled inductor are all studied and applied in this PFC.   Furthermore, the technology of soft switching totem-pole PFC is extended to a bidirectional rectifier/inverter design. By using SiC MOSFETs, both operating voltage and power are dramatically increased so that it is successfully applied into a bidirectional on-board charger (OBC) which achieves significantly improved efficiency and power density comparing to the best of industrial practice. In addition, a novel 2-stage system architecture and control strategy are proposed and demonstrated in the OBC system.   As a continued extension, the critical mode based soft switching rectifier/inverter technology is applied to three-phase AC/DC converter. The inherent drawback of critical mode due to variable frequency operation is overcome by the proposed new modulation method with the idea of frequency synchronization. It is the first time that a critical mode based modulation is demonstrated in the most conventional three phase H-bridge AC/DC converter, and with 99% plus efficiency at above 300 kHz switching frequency.\",","6510":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6511":"\"description-provenance\": [","6512":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-09T08:00:16Z (GMT).

Current methods for reducing pesticide exposure to bees involve the application of pesticides before crop bloom or in the evening when foraging bees are less likely to be exposed to these applications. There is an urgent need for additional protection procedures to reduce the annual losses of managed bee colonies.  Another method for protecting these pollinators is the use of chemical deterrents to reduce the interaction times of foraging bees with pesticide-treated crops.  Historically, insect repellents (IRs) have been used to prevent the spread of deadly human diseases by arthropod vectors.  However, it has been shown that bees can be repelled from pesticide-treated crops using DEET and bee pheromonal compounds.  Here, I report the toxicological and deterrent effects of bee pheromonal compounds, as well as the deterrent effects of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) on bees.  The results of this study indicate that the bee pheromonal compounds, at 8, 20, 60 and 100% concentrations, are toxic to bees and inhibit the feeding of bees within a confined space.  Additionally, the pheromonal compounds and the HCAs are as efficacious as DEET in deterring bees from treated food sources.  The HCA piperidine was observed to effectively deter bee foragers from a sugar feeder in a high-tunnel experiment as well as from melon flowers and knapweed in field experiments.  Electroantennogram recordings were conducted to verify an olfactory response of the bees to the tested compounds.  Pheromonal compounds were readily detected by bee antennae; whereas, the HCAs did not elicit significant responses in the bee antennae.  These data suggest that bee pheromonal compounds, as well as HCAs, may serve as candidates for the further investigation as repellents to protect bees from unintentional pesticide exposures.\",","6604":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6605":"\"description-provenance\": [","6606":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-10T08:01:02Z (GMT).

The experiments comprising this thesis research are on-going investigations of bacterial culture systems engineered to provide an environment that mimics biofilms while enabling real-time microscopy. Specifically, the microfluidic systems developed and assessed as part of this thesis permit the visualization of individual bacteria cells within consortia growing within a narrow space provided by a microfluidic device. This research demonstrates the versatility of these microfluidic systems across potentially high-throughput microbiological experiments utilizing genetically engineered Escherichia coli. Before demonstrating the efficacy of these systems, the development of the field of synthetic biology over the past half century is reviewed, focusing on synthetic genetic circuits and their applications (Chapter 2). The first and main microfluidic device explored in this research was developed to mimic the nutrient-deficient conditions within biofilms by forcing media to enter the culture area through a narrow, torturous channel. The microfluidic channel was thin enough (0.97 \u03bcm) to prevent the motility of 1-\u03bcm-wide E. coli cells, enabling visualization of individual cells. The bacteria cultured in the device contained either a simple Plux-driven quorum sensing receiver (Chapters 3 and 5) or a LacI- and TetR-driven genetic toggle switch (Chapter 4). Under the culture conditions, the quorum sensing reporter signal was detected even without addition of the signaling molecule (Chapter 3). The genetic toggle switch was stable when the system began in the high-LacI expression state, but after 5 days of culture, >5% of high-TetR expression cells began to consistently express the high-LacI state (Chapter 4). This system was also employed to track lineages of cells using real-time microscopy, which successfully characterized the inheritance of aberrant, enlarged cell phenotypes under stress (Chapter 5). Another microfluidic device, a droplet bioreactor, was also developed to culture small numbers of cells in an aqueous bubble suspended in oil (Chapter 6). Quorum sensing receiver cells were cultured in this device, demonstrating that it is well suited for testing the effects of compounds on biofilms within water-in-oil droplets.\",","6698":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6699":"\"description-provenance\": [","6700":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-14T08:00:27Z (GMT).

In this thesis, we focus on three projects (diffusion-based PCR, MID-RRBS, and SurfaceChIP-seq), which improved the sensitivities of conventional assays by coupling with microfluidic technology. MID-RRBS and SurfaceChIP-seq projects were designed to profiling genome-wide DNA methylation and histone modifications, respectively. These assays dramatically improved the sensitivities of conventional approaches over 1000 times without compromising genomic coverages. We applied these assays to examine the neuronal/glial nuclei isolated from mouse brain tissues. We successfully identified the distinctive epigenomic signatures from neurons and glia. Another focus of this thesis is applying electrical field to investigate the intracellular contents. We report two projects, drug delivery to encapsulated bacteria and mRNA extraction under ultra-high electrical field intensity.

High-throughput omic technologies for identifying and quantifying multi-level biological molecules (e.g., proteins, glycans, and metabolites) have facilitated the advances in biological research in recent years. Liquid (or gas) chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/GC-MS) has become an essential tool in such large-scale omic studies. Appropriate LC/GC-MS data preprocessing pipelines are needed to detect true differences between biological groups. Challenges exist in several aspects of MS data analysis. Specifically for biomarker discovery, one fundamental challenge in quantitation of biomolecules is owing to the heterogeneous nature of human biospecimens. Although this issue has been a subject of discussion in cancer genomic studies, it has not yet been rigorously investigated in mass spectrometry based omic studies. Purification of mass spectometric data is highly desired prior to subsequent differential analysis.  In this research dissertation, we majorly target at addressing the purification problem through probabilistic modeling. We propose an intensity-level purification model (IPM) to computationally purify LC/GC-MS based cancerous data in biomarker discovery studies. We further extend IPM to scan-level purification model (SPM) by considering information from extracted ion chromatogram (EIC, scan-level feature). Both IPM and SPM belong to the category of topic modeling approach, which aims to identify the underlying \\"topics\\" (sources) and their mixture proportions in composing the heterogeneous data. Additionally, denoise deconvolution model (DMM) is proposed to capture the noise signals in samples based on purified profiles. Variational expectation-maximization (VEM) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to draw inference on the latent variables and estimate the model parameters. Before we come to purification, other research topics in related to mass spectrometric data analysis for cancer biomarker discovery are also investigated in this dissertation.  Chapter 3 discusses the developed methods in the differential analysis of LC/GC-MS based omic data, specifically for the preprocessing in data of LC-MS profiled glycans. Chapter 4 presents the assumptions and inference details of IPM, SPM, and DDM. A latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) core is used to model the heterogeneous cancerous data as mixtures of topics consisting of sample-specific pure cancerous source and non-cancerous contaminants.  We evaluated the capability of the proposed models in capturing mixture proportions of contaminants and cancer profiles on LC-MS based serum and tissue proteomic and GC-MS based tissue metabolomic datasets acquired from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis. Chapter 5 elaborates these applications in cancer biomarker discovery, where typical single omic and integrative analysis of multi-omic studies are included.\",","6796":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6797":"\"description-provenance\": [","6798":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-15T08:00:32Z (GMT).

An ecological perspective framed the discussion to provide a holistic picture of the postsecondary needs of adolescents experiencing emotional disturbances in urban environments. Using a constructivist grounded theory qualitative approach; themes emerged and provided a voice to urban high school counselors on the concepts related to the postsecondary planning process. Two primary themes were attributed to the postsecondary planning perspectives of urban high school counselors with each theme including three sub-themes. Elements hindering postsecondary planning included (1) school resources, (2) poor parent engagement, and (3) higher-level needs; while elements supporting postsecondary planning incorporated (1) school personnel, (2) high parent engagement, and (3) computer-based planning resources. Three themes were linked to the postsecondary planning practices of urban high school counselors(1) college campus connection, (2) information dissemination, and (3) student-counselor connection. Three themes were also associated with the postsecondary planning experiences of urban high school counselors(1) learning from mistakes, (2) planning multiple options, and (3) similar planning for all students. These eight primary themes and six sub-themes provide evidence that offers a greater understanding of the postsecondary planning process for students experiencing emotional disturbances in urban environments.

Due to its ability to shape the way that individuals interact with other potential hosts and the environment, behavior is one of the most salient ways through which host biology varies in the context of disease. Variation in animal behavior can impact both transmission and the extent of a host's pathogen acquisition, and thus can have important consequences for infectious disease dynamics. Additionally, in this world of rapid urbanization where landscapes and wildlife resources are being altered, it is important to understand the ways in which human activity impact wildlife behavior, and in turn, disease dynamics. Here, we used both observational and experimental studies in field and laboratory settings to investigate the relationships among host behavior and physiology, anthropogenic food sources, and disease transmission in a natural host-pathogen system. First, we examined the relationship between house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) stress physiology, exploratory behaviors, and social behaviors in the wild. We provided evidence that more exploratory house finches interact with more individuals in the wild, and have higher baseline concentrations of circulating stress hormones. Next, we found evidence that the amount of time spent on bird feeders drives both the acquisition and transmission of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Mg), indicating that variation in host foraging behavior has important transmission consequences in this system. Lastly, we found that the density of bird feeders available to house finches predicts the extent of Mg transmission in captivity. Taken together, these results highlight the important role that behavioral heterogeneity can play in the acquisition and spread of pathogens, as well as the potential impacts of human behavior on wildlife disease dynamics. Future work should seek to identify specific physiological mechanisms driving Mg acquisition and transmission as they relate to variation in host behavior, and the ways in which bird feeders impact disease-relevant behaviors in the wild.\",","6887":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6888":"\"description-provenance\": [","6889":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-17T08:00:34Z (GMT).

However, differential expression analysis on independent studies for the same clinical types of patients often led to different sets of significant biomolecules and had only few in common. This may be attributed to the fact that biomolecules are members of strongly intertwined biological pathways and highly interactive with each other. Without considering these interactions, differential expression analysis could lead to biased results.   Network-based methods provide a natural framework to study the interactions between biomolecules. Commonly used data-driven network models include relevance network, Bayesian network and Gaussian graphical models. In addition to data-driven network models, there are many publicly available databases such as STRING, KEGG, Reactome, and ConsensusPathDB, where one can extract various types of interactions to build knowledge-driven networks. While both data- and knowledge-driven networks have their pros and cons, an appropriate approach to incorporate the prior biological knowledge from publicly available databases into data-driven network model is desirable for more robust and biologically relevant network reconstruction.  Recently, there has been a growing interest in differential network analysis, where the connection in the network represents a statistically significant change in the pairwise interaction between two biomolecules in different groups. From the rewiring interactions shown in differential networks, biomolecules that have strongly altered connectivity between distinct biological groups can be identified. These biomolecules might play an important role in the disease under study. In fact, differential expression and differential network analyses investigate omic data from two complementary perspectivesthe former focuses on the change in individual biomolecule level between different groups while the latter concentrates on the change in pairwise biomolecules level. Therefore, an approach that can integrate differential expression and differential network analyses is likely to discover more reliable and powerful biomarkers.   To achieve these goals, we start by proposing a novel data-driven network model (i.e., LOPC) to reconstruct sparse biological networks. The sparse networks only contains direct interactions between biomolecules which can help researchers to focus on the more informative connections. Then we propose a novel method (i.e., dwgLASSO) to incorporate prior biological knowledge into data-driven network model to build biologically relevant networks. Differential network analysis is applied based on the networks constructed for biologically disparate groups to identify cancer biomarker candidates. Finally, we propose a novel network-based approach (i.e., INDEED) to integrate differential expression and differential network analyses to identify more reliable and powerful cancer biomarker candidates. INDEED is further expanded as INDEED-M to utilize omic data at different levels of human biological system (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), which we believe is promising to increase our understanding of cancer. Matlab and R packages for the proposed methods are developed and available at Github (https://github.com/Hurricaner1989) to share with the research community.\",","6936":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6937":"\"description-provenance\": [","6938":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-17T08:00:41Z (GMT).

It is most common, perhaps, that this process generates a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary or partial differential equations. For this class of systems, the models derived from morphology of the skeleton are usually very high dimensional, nonlinear, and complex. This is particularly true if joint and link flexibility are included in the model. In addition to complexities that arise from morphology of the animal, some of the external forces that influence the dynamics of animal motion are very hard to model. A very well-established example of these forces is the unsteady aerodynamic forces applied to the wings and the body of insects, birds, and bats. These forces result from the interaction of the flapping motion of the wing and the surround- ing air. These forces generate lift and drag during flapping flight regime. As a result, they play a significant role in the description of the physics that underlies such systems. In this research we focus on dynamic and kinematic models that govern the motion of ground based robots that emulate flapping flight. The restriction to ground based biologically inspired robotic systems is predicated on two observations. First, it has become increasingly popular to design and fabricate bio-inspired robots for wind tunnel studies. Second, by restricting the robotic systems to be anchored in an inertial frame, the robotic equations of motion are well understood, and we can focus attention on flapping wing aerodynamics for such nonlinear systems. We study nonlinear modeling, identification, and control problems that feature the above complexities. This document summarizes research progress and plans that focuses on two key aspects of modeling, identification, and control of nonlinear dynamics associated with flapping flight.\",","6982":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","6983":"\"description-provenance\": [","6984":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-20T08:01:04Z (GMT).

Adolescence is a developmentally important time where independence grows, risks are taken, and some begin to experiment with substances (Burrow-Sanchez, 2006). Further, there is a high association between substance use and risk-taking behaviors, which can lead to involvement in the juvenile justice system. The rates of substance use are more alarming for juvenile delinquents (78%) (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, 2004). Along with risk factors associated with early onset substance use, researchers have identified several protective factors including involvement in positive relationships with parents. In this dissertation, I studied gender-specific relationships between parent and child that were associated with lower rates of substance use among at-risk adolescents. I investigated if this relationship mitigated the effects of negative peer association on substance use among adolescents. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to complete analysis using secondary data. The sample consisted of 166 adolescents who were involved in the juvenile justice system. Results showed that higher relationship quality with mothers was found to be statistically significant in predicting lower substance use. Overall, gender was not found to predict substance use, nor did it moderate the relationship between negative peer association and substance use. Results from this study can inform prevention and intervention efforts by heightening awareness regarding the protective nature of relationships with parents, specifically with mothers for at-risk adolescents. Further research is needed to explore these gender differences more in-depth. It will be important to continue to explore gender-specific relationships and the various aspects of parenting that can lower the risk for substance use among at-risk adolescents.\",","7030":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7031":"\"description-provenance\": [","7032":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-20T08:01:12Z (GMT).

Although exercise is widely accepted for prevention and treatment, evidence of resistance to exercise in patients with these diseases is also mounting. Muscle contraction during exercise stimulate cellular responses important for adaptation.  These responses include the release of myokines and the subsequent increase in substrate metabolism.  This study aimed to define a culture model for simulating exercise in human primary skeletal muscle cells.  We hypothesized that chronic electric pulse stimulation (EPS) of human myotubes in vitro would emulate cellular and molecular responses to exercise observed in vivo.  To define this model, we applied EPS to human myotubes for varied lengths of time and measured interleukin-6 (Il-6), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1- (PGC1-), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), substrate metabolism, metabolic enzyme activity, heat stress markers, and pH.  To recreate the inflammatory milieu observed in metabolic disease states we treated the myotubes with a low dose of 20 EU lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  Following the 24-hour stimulation we observed significant increases in transcription of Il-6, PGC1-, and SOD2.  Basal glucose and fatty acid oxidation were also markedly increased in the cells after EPS.  Cells treated with LPS elicited a blunted transcriptional, metabolic, and enzymatic response to EPS.  These findings suggest that EPS is a viable model for simulating the effects of exercise.  Our observations also indicate that an inflammatory environment could play a role in interfering with the adaptations to exercise.\",","7166":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7167":"\"description-provenance\": [","7168":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-21T08:01:34Z (GMT).

However, little is known about how close friends socialize adolescents' emotions or how friends' socialization messages compare to those from parents in adolescence. The present study will explore how parents and friends discuss negative emotions with adolescents in relation to adolescents' emotion regulation and internalizing symptoms.  Participants were 30 parent-adolescent-friend triads from a community sample. Parent and friend emotion socialization was observed during two discourse tasks (one with the parent, one with the friend) regarding a past negative event.  Adolescents also reported parent and friend emotion socialization responses. Adolescents' emotion regulation was measured via heart rate variability during a baseline task (i.e., watching an animal and nature video) and via a parent-report questionnaire. Lastly, adolescents reported their internalizing symptoms on a standard questionnaire. Correlations showed that the two methods for emotion socialization (observations, questionnaires) were largely not concordant, and the different measurements of emotion regulation were also not concordant.  Repeated measures MANOVAs showed that parents and friends differed in their use of various emotion socialization responses, as parents were observed to be higher in emotion coaching and co-rumination. Adolescents reported that parents were higher in emotion coaching and emotion dismissing, and friends were higher in co-rumination. These differences were not moderated by adolescent sex. Contrary to hypotheses, adolescent emotion regulation was not correlated with adolescent internalizing symptoms and did not mediate the association of parents' and friends' socialization of negative emotions with adolescent internalizing symptoms. This study unites the parent and friend literatures on emotion socialization and indicates that parents and friends are distinct socialization agents during adolescence. This study also offers insight into methodological approaches for measuring emotion socialization and emotion regulation, particularly that emotion socialization measurements need to be sensitive to the structural differences of family relationships and friendships. Future directions include exploring a wider range of socialization agents and how they may interact to influence adolescent development, amongst other topics.\",","7212":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7213":"\"description-provenance\": [","7214":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-23T08:00:36Z (GMT).

Sixty-nine studies meet inclusion criteria. The results show that participants receiving intervention with nutrition education experienced a reduction of 2.07 kg (95% CI1.52 to 2.62; p<0.001; 95% CI88.61% to 92.87%) in weight at 12 months with effect sizes over time ranging from small (0.17, 95% CI0.04 to 0.30; p=0.012; 95% CI80.42% to 91.14%) to medium (0.65, 95% CI0.49 to 0.82; p<0.001; 95% CI98.52% to 98.94). In sum, lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing body weight and glucose-related outcomes. Dietitian-delivered interventions achieve greater weight reduction compared to those delivered by other personnel.  In chapter 2, this study attempts to examine the effects of household relative deprivation on children's health outcomes. A modified household production model is developed with energy intake, energy expenditure and a composite good as main inputs in the health production. A two-stage Stackelberg game facilitates the need to model the parent-child interaction which follows similar structure as You and Davis (2011). We use three measurements of relative deprivation based on per capita household income and four reference groups based on combinations of geographic and demographic characteristics. The results show that relative deprivation is negatively associated with child health.  In chapter 3, we define \\"process benefits\\" as the direct effect on utility from engaging in an activity and examine how \\"process benefits\\" associated with food activities, both uptake and duration, are related to factors such as socio-economic status and demographics. A household production model is utilized to demonstrate the vital role of process benefits in home food production and the implications it will have for nutrition based policies targeting resources. The results display that the process benefits are associated with some demographic characteristics. This implies that shortfalls in food activities are not simply a matter of technology or resource shortfalls, but also reflect disutility associated from these activities which in turn will attenuate the impact of policies design to merely address resource shortfalls.\",","7258":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7259":"\"description-provenance\": [","7260":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-23T08:01:15Z (GMT).

The study of mosquito genomics provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in every aspect of vector biology, such as sex determination, host-parasite interaction, ecology, feeding behavior, immunity and evolutionary trends and can be used for the development of new strategies for vector control.    We developed the first map of the mitotic chromosomes of the major vector for West Nile fever and lymphatic filariasis, Culex quinquefasciatus. The map was then successfully utilized for mapping of approximately 90% of available genetic markers to their precise positions on the chromosomes. Idiograms were integrated with 140 genetic supercontigs representing 26.5% of the genome.  A linear regression analysis demonstrated good overall correlation between the positioning of markers on physical and genetic linkage maps. This will improve gene annotation and help in distinguishing potential haplotype scaffolds and regions of segmental duplications. It will also facilitate identification of epidemiologically important genes that can be used as targets for the vector control and provide a better framework for comparative genomics that will help understanding of the evolution of epidemiologically important traits.      In another study, we confirmed the presence of the newly described species, Anopheles daciae, in regions of Russia using molecular data. Although sympatric with its sibling species, Anopheles messeae, five nucleotide substitutions in the internal transcribed spacer 2 of ribosomal DNA can be used to distinguish the morphologically similar species. Chromosome rearrangements have a significant impact on mosquito adaptation and speciation. Using sequencing data in combination with karyotyping, we demonstrated that significant differences in inversion frequencies distinguish An. messeae from An. daciae, suggesting that these inversions are actively involved in adaptation and speciation. It is essential to have reliable toolbox for correct identification of these species and to know their range for future possible malaria outbreaks prevention.\",","7304":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7305":"\"description-provenance\": [","7306":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-24T08:00:52Z (GMT).

Industry reports and academic publications suggest that, in terms of road infrastructure, both advanced and developing economies have not paid sufficient attention to modernize their infrastructure assets. A wider road infrastructure gap signifies that highway conditions have declined because governments have not had enough resources for maintenance and rehabilitation. In the same way, it also indicates that congestion levels have grown and the level of service in most road networks has dropped because public agencies have not had sufficient funds to generate new highways and expand existing corridors. This dissertation, therefore, provided insights into the difficulties associated with improving the existing highway assets and the barriers related to expanding the current roadway capacity through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The research involved three interdependent studies. In the first study, I examined the continuous deterioration of the US highway system through a system dynamics model, which focused on the dynamics of capital investments and maintenance expenditures in the US road infrastructure. The results confirmed that the American highway system is currently stuck in a capability trap. This makes it difficult for the system to improve at the rates required by the country's economic growth. In my second investigation, my attention shifted toward the governance challenges related to building new roads and expanding highway capacity through PPPs. I developed a systems map of governance variables informed by past-published evidence from actual projects. By specifically examining the shaping phase of public-private initiatives, the work uncovered the effects of feedback relationships and interdependencies on PPP feasibility. This offered insights about the relationship between governance mechanisms and successful PPP development. In the third study, I utilized variables and relationships identified in my second investigation to develop a management flight simulator in order to better explain governance difficulties in the procurement phase of PPP projects. The simulator was implemented during an educational exercise with graduate students of civil engineering. By doing so, I confirmed that the simulator has the potential to increase our understanding of PPP procurement processes. Results indicated that the simulation tool was a suitable instrument to explain how government capacity, project uncertainty, and technical complexity influence PPP tendering. Overall, my findings across the three studies illustrate different means to understand why closing the global road infrastructure gap is challenging. Together, the three inquiries indicate that examining the road infrastructure sector as a socio-technical system contributes to improve our understanding of the expenditure dynamics related to existing assets and to enhance our comprehension of the governance challenges associated with developing new roads.\",","7348":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7349":"\"description-provenance\": [","7350":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-27T08:00:40Z (GMT).

However, the understanding and prediction of sediment transport are hindered by its complex dynamics and regimes. In this dissertation, the open-source solver SediFoam is developed for high-fidelity particle-resolving simulations of various sediment transport problems based on open-source solvers OpenFOAM and LAMMPS. OpenFOAM is a CFD toolbox that can perform three-dimensional flow simulations on unstructured mesh; LAMMPS is a massively parallel DEM solver for molecular dynamics. To enable the particle-resolving simulation of sediment transport on an arbitrary mesh, a diffusion-based algorithm is used in SediFoam to obtain the averaged Eulerian fields from discrete particle data. The parallel interface is also implemented for the communication of the two open-source solvers.  Extensive numerical simulations are performed to validate the capability of SediFoam in the modeling of sediment transport problems. The predictions of various sediment transport regimes, including `flat bed in motion', `small dune' and `vortex dune', are in good agreement of with the experimental results and those obtained by using interface resolved simulations. The capability of the solver in the simulation of sediment transport in the oscillatory boundary layer is also demonstrated.  Moreover, this well-validated high-fidelity simulation tool has been used to probe the physics of particle dynamics in self-generated bedforms in various hydraulic conditions. The results obtained by using SediFoam not only bridge the gaps in the experimental results but also help improve the engineering practice in the understanding of sediment transport. By using the particle-resolving simulation results and the insights generated therein, the closure terms in the two-fluid models or hydro-morphodynamic models can be improved, which can contribute to the numerical modeling of sediment transport in engineering scales.\",","7394":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7395":"\"description-provenance\": [","7396":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-27T08:01:02Z (GMT).

Compared to traditional project delivery approaches, PPPs are long-term contracts between the public and the private sectors, where the private sector is engaged in more project tasks and accepts more risks. However, due to their long-term and complex nature, PPP contracts face many issues. Consequently, each project's contract becomes vital to project success because itallocates risks, governs project relationships, and can align parties' interests. This dissertation examined 21 project contracts in the US highway PPP market to investigate risk allocation; contract designs and risk sharing mechanisms; and revenue risk guarantees. Using a content analysis framework, the allocation of 31 risks associated with highway PPPs was determined. These risks were mostly transferred to the private sector or shared between public and private parties, and project context had a significant influence on risk allocation. Assessment of contract designs indicated that the public sector imposes extensive monitoring and retains a majority of the decision rights to preclude opportunistic actions by the private sector; further, risk sharing mechanisms were complex and largely dependent on resolution during project implementation, which likely increases ex post transaction costs. Finally, revenue guarantees, commonly structured as standard options to mitigate revenue risk, were redesigned to incorporate exotic option features; quantitative analysis revealed that exotic structures can better serve chief PPP stakeholders' interests through increased robustness and flexibility.\",","7439":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7440":"\"description-provenance\": [","7441":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-29T08:00:25Z (GMT).

Despite national efforts to improve graduates' competencies, managers and other critical industry stakeholders consistently describe new hires as underprepared for practice. Nonetheless, as engineers move into their new organizations, they learn to participate in and contribute to their communities of practice. This period is the school-to-work transition, and the goal of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the salient learning events that characterize individuals' trajectories from engineering student to engineering practitioner.    Using a multi-case approach, this study leverages weekly journals and semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of recent engineering graduates as they enter the workplace and learn to engage in professional practice. Journal entries probed newcomers' perceptions of challenges, accomplishments, and significant learning events during the first 12 weeks of their jobs. Interviews expanded on journal findings and elaborated on participants' experiences. Analysis entailed the development and application of two complementary workplace learning frameworks from Jacobs and Park (2009) and Chao et al. (1994) that describe both the setting and content of salient learning experiences. Cross-case analysis enabled exploration across participants to examine trends and patterns within participants' experiential trajectories.    Findings point to several contributions and implications. First, the codebooks developed in this study were contextualized and operationalized for engineering workplaces, and have been refined to enhance descriptive precision and clarity. Second, journals provided thick, rich descriptions of events in ways that hold promise for future exploratory studies as well as formative assessment. Finally, results indicated that newcomer engineers engage in a wide range of learning environments throughout the school-to-work transition and describe learning along myriad socialization dimensions. In particular, workplace learning takes place in unstructured environments through routine tasks and along both technical and sociocultural dimensions. Given this learning, both industry and academic professionals should consider these dimensions as they design experiences and assess learning across organizations. Newcomer learning is challenging, but if we can gain a better understanding of how and what happens during it, we can more effectively develop efforts to enhance the transition\u2014and therefore, practice\u2014for future generations of engineers.\",","7487":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7488":"\"description-provenance\": [","7489":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-29T08:00:32Z (GMT).

This dissertation focuses on comparative evaluations under ALF, MMLS 3 and APA tests, in terms of rut depth, strain response, seismic stiffness, and contact stress using both experimental and numerical simulation results. Test slabs extracted from the ALF test lanes, are trafficked with the MMLS3 under comparable environmental conditions at laboratory in Virginia Tech. Some specimens were cut from the slabs for APA tests at VTRC. It is found that the monitored parameters yielded by the MMLS 3 test were comparable to the related full-scale ALF test results in terms of intrinsic material characteristics and pavement performance. The wireless sensor network based on Internet of things technology is implemented in laboratory for the MMLS 3 test, which provides a convenient solution for researchers on long-term observation and monitoring without being physically presented. The numerical simulations of ALF, MMLS 3 and APA in ABAQUS are used to supplement the investigation on the pavement response and performance under repeated moving loading. The viscoelastic-viscoplastic model is adopted to characterize rate and temperature dependent properties of asphalt mixtures.  The 3D finite element models are capable of predicting the pavement response at critical locations while underestimates the rut depth because the permanent deformation induced by volumetric change cannot be represented in simulation.  According to the test results, a power law function fits well for the accumulated rut depth versus number of load repetitions before the material reaches tertiary stage in MMLS 3 test. The rut depth development of APA tests exhibits a close-to-liner regression with number of load cycles after the initial 500 load repetitions. A regression model for predicting rut depth after 500 loads has a satisfying agreement with the experimental measurement. The calibrated MEPDG fatigue model can be used to estimate the allowable load repetitions in MMLS 3 trafficking. Besides, the effects of tire configuration, tire pressure, axle load amplitude, wheel load speed and temperature on pavement responses are investigated in this dissertation using the finite element model.  It is concluded that MMLS 3 is an effective, economic and reliable trafficking tool to characterize rutting and fatigue performance of pavement materials with due regard to the relative structures. MMLS 3 test can be employed as the screen testing for establishing full-scale testing protocols as desired or required, which will significantly enhance economics of APT testing.\",","7530":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7531":"\"description-provenance\": [","7532":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-01T08:00:38Z (GMT).

Planar magnetics are widely used in bias power supplies for the benefits of low profile and their compatibility with printed-circuit boards (PCB). The coupled inductors with winding layers sandwiched between two core plates are studied in this dissertation in order to model the self-inductance, winding loss, and core loss.   The most challenging task for the plate-core inductor is to model the magnetic field with finite core dimensions, very non-uniform flux pattern, and large fringing flux. The winding is placed near the edge of the core to maximize the energy within the limited footprint and the amount of energy stored outside the core volume is not negligible. The proportional-reluctance, equal-flux (PREF) model is developed to build the contours with equal amount of flux by governing the reluctance of the flux path. The shapes of the flux lines are modeled by different functions that guided by the finite-element simulation (FES). The field from the flux lines enables calculation of inductance, winding loss, and core loss, etc.    The inductance matrix including self-inductance and mutual inductance of a coupled inductor is important for circuit simulation and evaluation. The derivation of the inductance matrix of inductors with plate-core structure is described in Chapter 2. Two conditions are defined as common-mode (CM) field and differential-mode (DM) field in order to compute the matrix parameters. The proportional-reluctance, equal-flux (PREF) model introduced is employed to find the CM field distribution, and the DM field distribution is found from functions analogous to that of a solenoid's field. The inductance calculated are verified by flex-circuit prototypes with various dimensions, and the application of the inductance model is presented at the last with normalized parameters to cover structures within a wide-range.    In circuit where coupled inductors are used instead of transformers, the phase shift between the primary and secondary side is not always 180 degrees. Therefore, it is important to model the winding loss for a coupled inductor accurately. The winding loss can be calculated from the resistance matrix, which is independent of excitations but only relates to the frequency and geometry. The methodology to derive the resistance matrix from winding losses of coupled inductors is discussed. Winding loss model with 2D magnetic field is improved by including the additional eddy current loss for better accuracy for the plate-core structures. The resistance matrix calculated from the model is verified by both measurement results and finite-element simulation (FES) of coupled-inductor prototypes.   Accurate core loss model is required for designing magnetic components in power converters. Most existing core loss models are based on frequency domain calculation and they cannot be implemented in SPICE simulations. The core loss model in the time domain is discussed in Chapter 5 for arbitrary current excitations. An effective ac flux density is derived to simplify the core loss calculation with non-uniform field distribution. A sub-circuit for core loss simulation is established in LTSPICE that is capable of being integrated to the power stage simulation. Transient behavior and accurate simulation results from the LTSPICE matches very well with the FES results.   An equivalent circuit for coupled windings is developed for inductors with significant fringing effect. The equivalent circuit is derived from a physical model that captures the flux paths by having a leakage inductor and two mutual inductors on the primary and secondary side. A mutual resistor is added to each side in parallel with one mutual inductor to model the winding loss with open circuit and phase-shift impact. Two time-varying resistors are employed to represent the core loss in the time-domain. The equivalent circuit is verified by both finite-element simulation (FES) and prototypes fabricated with flexible circuit.\",","7577":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7578":"\"description-provenance\": [","7579":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-01T08:01:37Z (GMT).

The movement of the power system in parameter and state space is often not well understood, thus making it difficult or impossible to determine whether the system is nearing instability. This dissertation demonstrates several ways in which the power system stability boundary can be calculated. The power system movements evaluated here address the effects of inter-area oscillations on the system which occur in the seconds to minutes time period.   The first uses gain scheduling techniques through creation of a set of linear parameter varying (LPV) systems for many operating points of the non-linear system. In the case presented, load and line reactance are used as parameters. The scheduling variables are the power flows in tie lines of the system due to the useful information they provide about the power system state in addition to being available for measurement. A linear controller is developed for the LPV model using H\u2082/H\u221e  with pole placement objectives. When the control is applied to the non-linear system, the proposed algorithm predicts the response of the non-linear system to the control by determining if the current system state is located within the domain of attraction of the equilibrium. If the stability domain contains a convex combination of the two points, the control will aid the system in moving towards the equilibrium.   The second contribution of this thesis is through the development and implementation of a pseudo non-linear evaluation of a power system as it moves through state space. A system linearization occurs first to compute a multi-objective state space controller. For each contingency definition, many variations of the power system example are created and assigned to the particular contingency class. The powerflow variations and contingency controls are combined to run sets of time series analysis in which the Lyapunov function is tracked over three time steps.

Animal manure applications to agricultural fields for nutrient management can be a source of environmental hormones.  This dissertation investigates the occurrence of hormones in fields applied with various manures and their adjacent streams, as well as the effect of manure application technologies on the fate of hormones in soils, sediments, and runoff.  A total of 11 hormone compounds were studied. All studied analytes were quantified using liquid chromatography and triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry following various sample extraction and clean-up strategies.    The spatial and temporal distribution of manure-associated hormones in a manure surface applied agricultural field and adjacent stream was studied at time points up to 7.5 months after a routine manure application.  Hormones were detected mainly in the top 0-5cm soils.  Significantly higher levels of hormones were found in the drystack applied area of the field when compared to dairy manure slurry applied portion.    New technologies for the subsurface application of poultry litter show promise as a tool to reduce the transportation of environmental hormones in surface runoff.  Once adequate  sampling protocols were established; it was determined that subsurface injection of both dairy manure and poultry litter reduced the impact of manure surface runoff.   Hormones also showed little vertical and lateral movement in the soil.      The transformation rates of 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione, 4-androstene-3,17-dione and estrone were studied comparing the effects of temperature, soil type, and application type. The calculated half-life of 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione in poultry litter surface-applied soils was 1.9 times higher than that in the poultry litter subsurface-injected soils, indicating a faster dissipation rate in the injection slits.  Estrone persisted at detectable levels for the duration of the study in all treatments.    The continued use of best management practices and innovative manure management techniques for the reduction of nutrients, sediment and other contaminants has the potential to also reduce hormone transport to the natural environment.  Monitoring many different types of hormones in all areas of an environmental system will continue to provide better information on the occurrence and fate of hormones sourced from manure amended soils.\",","7760":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7761":"\"description-provenance\": [","7762":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-15T08:00:24Z (GMT).

Scientific visualization deals with data that have natural spatial mapping such as maps, buildings interiors or even your physiological body parts, while information visualization involves abstract, non-spatial data. Visual analytics uses either visualization types to gain deep inferences about scientific data or information. In recent years, a variety of techniques have been developed combining statistical and visual analysis tools to represent data of different types in one view to enable data fusion. One vital feature of such visualization tools is the support for comparisonshowing the differences between two or more objects. This feature is called visual differencing, or discrimination. Visual differencing is a common requirement across different research domains, helping analysts compare different objects in the data set or compare different attributes of the same object. From a visual analytic point of view, this research examines humans' predictable bias in interpreting visual-spatial, spatiotemporal information, and inference-making in scientific visualization. Practically, I examined different case studies from different domains such as land suitability in agriculture, spectrum sensing in software-defined radio networks, raster images in remote sensing, pattern recognition in point cloud, airflow distribution in aerodynamics, galaxy catalogs in astrophysics and protein membrane interaction in molecular dynamics. Each case required different computing power, ranging from personal computer to high performance cluster. Based on this experience across application domains, I propose a high-performance visualization paradigm for scientific visualization that supports three key features of scientific data analysisrepresentations, fusion, and visual discrimination. This paradigm is informed by practical work with multiple high-performance computing and visualization platforms from desktop displays to immersive CAVE displays. In order to evaluate the applicability of the proposed paradigm, I carried out two user studies. The first user study addressed the feature of data fusion with multivariate maps and the second one addressed visual differencing with three multi-view management techniques. The high-performance visualization paradigm and the results of these studies contribute to our knowledge of efficient MVMD designs and provides scientific visualization developers with a framework to mitigate the trade-offs of scalable visualization design such as the data mappings, computing power, and output modality.\",","7808":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7809":"\"description-provenance\": [","7810":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-15T08:00:36Z (GMT).

Viral infections are thought to be a significant factor contributing to these declines, along with exposure to agricultural and apicultural pesticides, but viruses have proven a challenging pathogen to study in a bee model and interactions between viruses and the bee antiviral immune response remain poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for inwardly-rectifying ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the cardiac regulation of the fruit fly antiviral immune response, but no information is available on their role in the heart-specific regulation of bee immunity. The results of this work demonstrate that KATP channel modulators have an observable effect on honey bee heart rate that supports their expected physiological role in bee cardiac function. Here, it is also reported that the entomopathogenic flock house virus (FHV) infects adult bees, causing rapid onset of mortality and accumulation of viral RNA. Furthermore, infection-mediated mortality can be altered by pre-exposure to KATP channel modulators. Finally, this work shows that exposure to environmental stressors such as commonly used in-hive acaricides can impact bee cardiac physiology and tolerance to viral infection. These results suggest that KATP channels provide a significant link between cellular metabolism and the antiviral immune response in bees and highlight the significant impact of environmental stressors on pollinator health.\",","7856":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7857":"\"description-provenance\": [","7858":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-15T08:00:42Z (GMT).

Many investigators turn to nanoparticles (~50-200 nm in size) that tend to accumulate in tumor tissues in order to deliver active drug compounds to specific sites in the body. This targeted delivery approach would reduce the total body effects of current cancer drugs that result in unwanted (sometimes painful and even fatal) side effects. One of the main obstacles however, is ensuring that drugs incorporated into the nanoparticles are anchored such that premature drug release is prohibited. Also, while it is important to ensure strong drug-nanocarrier interactions, the nanocarrier must be able to release the drug when it has reached its biological target. We have developed a nanocarrier that provides a platform for drug systems that could achieve this drug release via the use of a light \\"trigger\\".    Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of often highly porous materials that act as \\"sponges\\" for the absorption of various small molecules. MOFs are so named because they consist of metal clusters that are linked by organic compounds to form networked solids that are easily tuned based on the choice of metal and organic \\"linker\\". We have developed a MOF nanocarrier incorporating benign zirconium (IV) metal clusters bridged by an organic component that changes shape when illuminated with a light source. The resulting material is therefore not stable upon irradiation due to the organic linker shape change that disturbs the MOF structure and causes it to degrade. When loaded with drugs, this photo-enhanced degradation results in the release of the cargo thereby, providing a handle on controlling drug release with the use of a light trigger. We have demonstrated that in the presence of the MOF nanocarrier incorporating 5-fluorouracil (a clinically available cancer drug), very low toxicity to human breast cancer cells is observed in the dark, however, cell death occurs in the presence of a light source. These reports offer a model MOF nanocarrier system that could be used to incorporate various drugs and therefore tune the system to an individual patient's needs.   Furthermore, we also developed a material that is capable of providing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast by changing the metal to manganese (II). MRI contrast agents are compounds that serve to either darken or brighten an MRI image based on the agent used and therefore they aid in clinical diagnosis by making internal abnormalities easier to spot. Currently gadolinium (III) complexes are the most widely used contrast agents; however, the toxicity of gadolinium (III) has been shown to be responsible for the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in some patients. This manganese material has also shown useful for the attachment of fluorescent dyes that can aid in the benchtop optical diagnosis of biopsies. These reports provide a basis for developing ways to offer controlled drug delivery in cancer patients and to aid in cancer diagnosis using MOF materials, in an effort to reach the goals of comfortable cancer treatment.\",","7901":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","7902":"\"description-provenance\": [","7903":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-15T08:01:06Z (GMT).

The first essay is \\"Value of Supply Disruption Information and Information Accuracy\\", in which we examine the factors that influence the value of supply disruption information, investigate how information accuracy influences this value, and provide managerial suggestions to practitioners. The study is motivated by the fact that fully accurate disruption information may be difficult and costly to obtain and inaccurate disruption information can decrease the financial benefit of prior knowledge and even lead to negative performance. We perform the analysis by adopting a newsvendor model. The results show that information accuracy, specifically information bias and information variance, plays an important role in determining the value of disruption information. However, this influence varies at different levels of disruption severity and resilience capacity. The second essay is \\"Quantifying Supply Chain ResilienceA Dynamic Approach\\", in which we provide a new type of quantitative framework for assessing network resilience. This framework includes three basic elementsrobustness, recoverability and resilience, which can be assessed with respect to different performance measures. Then we present a comprehensive analysis on how network structure and other parameters influence these different elements. The results of this analysis clearly show that both researchers and practitioners should be aware of the possible tradeoffs among different aspects of supply chain resilience. The ability of the framework to support better decision making is then illustrated through a systemic analysis based on a real supply chain network. The third essay is \\"Network Characteristics and Supply Chain Disruption Resilience\\", in which we investigate the relationships between network characteristics and supply chain resilience. In this work, we first prove that investigating network characteristics can lead to a better understanding of supply chain resilience behaviors. Later we select key characteristics that play a critical role in determining network resilience.

Due to the constant push towards achieving high TIT, the heat load on high pressure turbine components has been increasing with time. Gas turbine airfoils are equipped with several sophisticated cooling technologies which protect them from harsh external environment and increase their operating life and reduce the maintenance cost. The turbine airfoils are coated with thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) and the external surface is protected by film cooling. The internals of gas turbine blades are cooled by relatively colder air bled off from the compressor discharge. Gas turbine internals can be divided into three broad segments \u2013 Leading edge section, (2) mid-chord section and (3) trailing edge section. The leading edge of the airfoil is subjected to extreme heat loads due to hot main gas stagnation and high turbulence intensity of the combustor exit gases. The leading edge is typically cooled by jet impingement which cross-over the rib turbulators in the feed chamber. The mid-chord section of the turbine airfoils have serpentine passages connected via. 180\u00b0 bends, and they feature turbulence promotors which enhance the heat exchange rates between the coolant and the internal walls of the airfoil. The trailing edge section is typically cooled by array of pin fins. On one hand, the coolant routed through the internal passages of turbine airfoil help maintain the airfoil temperatures within safe limits of operation, the cooled air comes at a cost of loss of high pressure air from the compressor section. The aim of this study is to develop internal cooling concepts which have high thermal hydraulic performance, i.e. to gain high levels heat transfer enhancement due to cooling concepts at lower pumping power requirements. Experimental and numerical studies have been carried out and new rib turbulator designs such as Criss-Cross pattern, compound channels featuring uniquely organized ribs and dimples, novel jet impingement hole shapes have  been developed which have high thermal-hydraulic performance.   Further, gas turbine blades rotate at high rotational speeds. The internal flow routed thought the serpentine passages are subjected to Coriolis and centrifugal buoyancy forces. The combined effects of these forces results in enhancement and reduction in heat transfer on the pressure side and suction side internal walls. This leads to non-uniformity in the heat transfer enhancement which leads to non-uniform cooling and increase in the sites of high and low internal wall temperatures. Development of cooling concepts which have high thermal hydraulic performance under non-rotating conditions is important, however, under rotation, the heat transfer characteristics of the internal passages is significantly different in an unfavorable way. So the aim of the turbine cooling research is to have concepts which provide highly efficient and uniform cooling. The negative effects of rotation has been addressed in this study and new orientation of two-pass cooling channels has been presented which utilizes the rotational energy in favor of heat transfer enhancement on both pressure and suction side internal walls.   Present study has led to several new cooling concepts which are efficient under both stationary and rotating conditions.\",","8038":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8039":"\"description-provenance\": [","8040":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-19T08:00:58Z (GMT).

The imaginative poetic language that some contemporary poetry enacts, resonates with Levinas\u2019s ethical motivations and methods for responding to alterity. The following project investigates facets of this question in relation to Levinashow do the contemporary poets Peter Blue Cloud, Jorie Graham, Joy Harjo, and Robert Hass use poetic language uniquely to engage with alterity in an ethical way, thus allowing it to retain its mystery and infinite nature? I argue that by keeping language alive in a way similar to a Levinasian saying, which avoids mastering otherness by attending to its uniqueness and imaginatively engaging with it, they enact an ethical response to alterity. As a way of unpacking these ideas, this inquiry will investigate the compelling, if unsettled, convergence in the work of Levinas and that of Blue Cloud, Graham, Harjo, and Hass by unfolding a number of Levinasian-informed close readings of major poems by these writers as foregrounding various forms of Levinasian saying.\",","8081":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8082":"\"description-provenance\": [","8083":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-19T08:02:23Z (GMT).

The onset of late Cenozoic glaciation, often associated with enhanced rates of erosion, is one such possible cause of passive margin rejuvenation. However, along passive margins the effectiveness of Plio-Pleistocene glaciers at eroding the landscape may be limited by low tectonic rock uplift rates or as a result of erosionally inefficient cold based continental ice-sheets. In this dissertation the evolution of post-orogenic topography and the effect of glaciations on denuding landscapes along the North Atlantic Passive Margin, in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the western Scottish Highlands, was investigated. Background exhumation rates averaged over 106-7 yr timescale were determined using apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology. To resolve whether or not a change in exhumation rate occurred coincident with glaciation these background exhumation rates were compared to magnitudes of erosion averaged over the glacially relevant 103-4 yr timescale using the in situ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide 10Be. In chapter two, 106-7 yr timescale exhumation and burial histories across the western Scottish Highlands were determined. The results show that post-orogenic burial and exhumation is mostly a result of plate margin distal tectonic and magmatic factors that are variable across short distances (i.e., <100 km). In chapter three, patterns and magnitudes of erosion during glaciation and following deglaciation in the Scottish Highlands were investigated. The results indicate that polythermal glacial erosion denuded low elevation portions of the Scottish Highlands and preserved summits. This produced relief but did not significantly lower the maximum elevation of the landscape. Following deglaciation Scotland's sediment budget remains dominated by glaciogenic sediment. In the fourth chapter, magnitudes of background exhumation in the Presidential and Carter Ranges of the White Mountains, New Hampshire were compared to magnitudes of glacial erosion. The results indicate that most relief was produced prior to glaciation and that background exhumation rates in the Cenozoic are low (<0.01 mm yr-1). In the late-Cenozoic, cold- based glaciation prevented an acceleration of erosion in the White Mountains. The post- glacial sediment budget is made up of dominantly glaciogenic sediment. Overall, the main findings of this dissertation are; (1) post-orogenic burial, exhumation, and relief production are mainly the result of spatially heterogeneous plate margin distal vertical crustal motions; across passive margins covered by large continental ice sheets;   (2) cold-based ice limits the magnitudes of late Cenozoic glacial erosion   sediment budgets continue to be dominated by glaciogenic sediment, >10 ka after  and (3) post-glacial deglaciation.\",","8121":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8122":"\"description-provenance\": [","8123":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-20T08:00:38Z (GMT).

The effective manipulation of micro-particles is often crucial for achieving the desired functionality of microsystems and requires a fundamental understanding of the particle dynamics. In this dissertation, the dynamics of two types of micro-particles, Janus catalytic micromotors (JCMs) and magnetic clusters, in complex environment are studied using numerical simulations. The self-diffusiophoresis of JCMs in a confined environment is studied first. Overall, the translocation of a JCM through a short pore is slowed down by pore walls, although the slowdown is far weaker than the transport of particles through similar pores driven by other mechanisms. A JCM entering a pore with its axis not aligned with the pore axis can execute a self-alignment process and similar phenomenon is found for JCMs already inside the pore. Both hydrodynamic effect and 'chemical effect', i.e., the modification of the concentration of chemical species around JCMs by walls and other JCMs, play a key role in the observed dynamics of JCMs in confined and crowded environment.  The dynamics of bubbles and JCMs in liquid films covering solid substrates are studied next. A simple criterion for the formation of bubbles on isolated JCMs is developed and validated. The anomalous bubble growth law (r~t^0.7) is rationalized by considering the relative motion of growing bubbles and their surrounding JCMs. The experimentally observed ultra-fast collapse of bubbles is attributed to the coalescence of the bubble with the liquid film-air interface. It is shown that the collective motion of JCMs toward a bubble growing on a solid substrate is caused by the evaporation-induced Marangoni flow near the bubble.  The actuation of magnetic clusters using non-uniform alternating magnetic fields is studied next. It is discovered that the clusters' clockwise, out-of-plane rotation is a synergistic effect of the magnetophoresis force, the externally imposed magnetic torque and the hydrodynamic interactions between the cluster and the substrate. Such a rotation enables the cluster to move as a surface walker and leads to unique dynamics, e.g., the cluster moves away from the magnetic source and its trajectory exhibits a periodic fluctuation with a frequency twice of the field frequency.\",","8167":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8168":"\"description-provenance\": [","8169":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-22T08:00:23Z (GMT).

The use of passing fostered an outlet for many light-skinned men and women for inclusion. This trope also allowed for a closer investigation of the racial division in the United States during the 20th century.  These issues included questions of the color line, or more specifically, how light-skinned men and women passed as white to obtain elevated economic and social status. Secondary issues in these earlier passing novels included gender and sexuality, raising questions as to whether these too existed as fixed identities in society. As such, the phenomenon of passing illustrates not just issues associated with the color line, but also social, economic, and gender structure within society. Human beings exist in a matrix, and as such, passing is not plausible if viewed solely as a process occurring within only one of these social constructs, but, rather, insists upon a viewpoint of an intersectional construct of social fluidity itself. This paper will re-theorize passing from a description solely concerning racial movements into a theory that explores passing as an intersectional understanding of gender, sexuality, race, and class. This paper will focus on contemporary cultural products (e.g., novels) of passing that challenge the traditional notion of passing and focus on an intersectional linkage between race, gender, sexuality, and class.\",","8210":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8211":"\"description-provenance\": [","8212":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-27T08:00:21Z (GMT).

To achieve the first research objective, a Fourier Transform Interferometry (FTI) system was adopted to capture three-dimensional high-resolution images of aggregates. Based on these digital images, the FTI system uses the two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT2) method to rapidly measure aggregate morphological characteristics, including sphericity, flatness ratio, elongation ratio, angularity, and surface texture. The computed shape characteristics of all aggregates were in good agreement with manual measurement results, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of this image analysis system. For the second objective, a series of simple performance laboratory tests were performed on eight types of SMA mixtures with different morphological characteristics. Test included wheel-track loading, dynamic modulus, flow number, and beam fatigue. The wheel tracking test included asphalt pavement analyzer (APA) and Model mobile load simulator (MMLS). In the APA test, samples included eight types of SMA mixtures that consisted of aggregates of 22 fractions. In the MMLS test, six types of SMA mixture samples that consist of coarse aggregate of 15 fractions were tested. Regression analyses were then conducted between weighted mean morphological characteristics and performance parameters. The fatigue performance parameters include |E*|sin \u03c6, where |E*| is complex modulus obtained from dynamic modulus test, the number of loading cycles to failure, and the seismic modulus difference. The rutting performance parameters include |E*|/sin \u03c6, flow number, flow number slope, rut depth and creep slope. For the third objective, different coarse aggregate fractions from different quarries in Virginia were analyzed using the improved FTI system. Regression analyses were performed to investigate the correlation between morphological characteristics and uncompacted void content of coarse aggregates at the size ranges of 4.75-9.5mm and 9.5-12.5 mm, respectively. Aggregate morphological characteristics were found to play an important role in the mechanical performance of stone matrix asphalt mixture and the uncompacted air void content of the coarse aggregates. Both the experimental results and simulation results demonstrated that using more of equi-dimensional, less flaky and elongated coarse aggregates with angular and rougher-textured aggregates is favorable to the mechanical performances of SMA mixtures. Recommended values for each morphological characteristic are provided.\",","8255":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8256":"\"description-provenance\": [","8257":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-27T08:00:39Z (GMT).

We can learn from these biological systems, which have successfully evolved to operate in noisy and fault-prone environments, and understand how these complex interactions can be applied to engineered systems where robustness remains a major challenge. This dissertation addresses a two-scale approach to study these interactions- one in larger scale, where we are interested in the information exchange in a group and how it enables the group to reach a common decision, and the other in a smaller scale, where we are focused in the presence and directionality in the information exchange in a pair of individuals. To understand the interactions at large scale, we use a graph theoretic approach to study consensus or synchronization protocols over two types of biologically-inspired interaction networks. The first network captures both collaborative and antagonistic interactions and the second considers the impact of dynamic leaders in presence of purely collaborative interactions. To study the interactions at small scale, we use an information theoretic approach to understand the directionality of information transfer in a pair of individual using a real-world data-set of animal group motion. Finally, we choose the issue of same-sex marriage in the United States to demonstrate that collective opinion formation is not only a result of negotiations among the individuals, but also reflects inherent spatial and political similarities and temporal delays.\",","8397":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8398":"\"description-provenance\": [","8399":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-02T08:00:44Z (GMT).

I do this by studying the international patenting activities of EEs at the country level and firm level. In order to do this, I develop and analyze a panel database of patents filed with the United States Patents and Trademarks Office (USPTO). I then examine differences in the nature of technologies that are being patented by emerging economies in comparison to developed economies (DEs). Through this dissertation, I develop a key construct that pertains to the nature of technologies that are patented. This construct is named novelty of technology knowledge and it pertains to the age of technological knowledge that organizations draw from and build upon while developing new innovations. The first research question I examine is what is the impact of global connectedness and institutional development in EEs on the age of technology knowledge that they build on. I build on insights from the institutional theory and argue that the absence of well-developed institutions presents constraints to the development and protection of novel technology innovations. On the other hand, global connectedness in the form of trade linkages provides opportunities for engaging in novel technology innovations. I hypothesize that a country's level of global connectedness and institutional development have a positive relation with the novelty of its technology knowledge. I use data on the international patenting activities of 48 countries with the USPTO over a period of 9 years. I use panel data estimation models to test the hypotheses. I find that global connectedness is positively related to the level of a country's international patenting. The second research question is what is the impact of the level of internationalization of EE firms on the age of technology knowledge that they build on. I first identify the benefits and costs associated with internationalization for EE firms as a result of the conditions in their home country. I then argue that with increasing internationalization, the counter forces of exploration and exploitation thrust firms' technology development from initially focusing on newer technology bases towards focusing on older technologies. I hypothesize the existence of a U-shaped relationship between the level of internationalization and the novelty of technology knowledge and test my hypotheses using a panel of bio-pharmaceutical firms from India.

The methods for field attenuation usually introduce extra losses and reduce the efficiency. This study focuses on the synergetic attenuation of stray magnetic field which is optimized simultaneously with the efficiency. The optimization is realized with Pareto front.   In this dissertation, three methods are discussed for the field attenuation. The first method is to tune the physical parameters of the winding, such as the inner radii, outer radii, distribution of the turns, and types of the litz wires. The second method is to add metal shields around the IPT coils, in which litz wires are used as shields to reduce the shielding losses. The third method is to control the phases of winding currents, which avoids increasing the size and weight of the IPT coils.  To attenuate the stray magnetic field by tuning the physical parameters, the conventional method is to sweep all the physical parameters in finite-element simulation. This takes thousands of simulations to derive the Pareto front, and it's especially time-consuming for three-dimensional simulations. This dissertation demonstrates a faster method to derive the Pareto front. The windings are replaced by the lumped loops. As long as the number of turns for each loop is known, the efficiency and magnetic field are calculated directly from the permeance matrices and current-to-field matrices. The sweep of physical parameters in finite-element simulation is replaced by the sweep of the turns numbers for the lumped loops in calculation. Only tens of simulations are required in the entire procedure, which are used to derive the matrices. An exemplary set of coils was built and tested. The efficiency from the matrix calculation is the same as the experimental measurement. The difference for stray magnetic field is less than 12.5%.  Metal shields attenuate the stray magnetic field effectively, but generates significant losses owning to the uneven distribution of shield currents. This dissertation uses litz wires to replace the conventional plate shield or ring shield. Skin effect is eliminated so the shield currents are uniformly distributed and the losses are reduced. The litz shields are categorized to two typesshorted litz shield and driven litz shield. Circuit models are derived to analyze their behaviors. The concept of lumped-loop model is applied to derive the Pareto front of efficiency versus stray magnetic field for the coils with litz shield. In an exemplary IPT system, coils without metal shield and with metal shields are optimized for the same efficiency. Both the simulation and experimental measurement verify that the shorted litz shield has the best performance. The stray magnetic field is attenuated by 65% compared to the coils without shield.   This dissertation also introduces the method to attenuate the stray magnetic field by controlling the phases of winding currents. The magnetic field around the coils is decomposed to the component in the axial direction and the component in the radial direction. The axial component decreases with smaller phase difference between windings' currents, while the radial component exhibits the opposite property. Because the axial component is dominant around the IPT coils, decreasing the phase difference is preferred. The dual-side-controlled converter is applied for the circuit realization. Bridges with active switches are used for both the inverter on the transmitter side and the rectifier on the receiver side. The effectiveness of this method was verified both in simulation and experiment. Compared to the conventional series-series IPT with 90\u00b0 phase difference between winding currents, stray magnetic field was attenuated by up to 30% and 40% when the phase differences of winding currents are 50\u00b0 and 40\u00b0, respectively.  Furthermore, an analytical method is investigated to calculate the proximity-effect resistance of the planar coils with ferrite plate. The objective of this method is to work together with the fast optimization which uses the lumped-loop model. The existence of the ferrite plate complicates the calculation of the magnetic field across each turn which is critical to derive the proximity-effect resistance. In this dissertation, the ferrite plate is replaced by the mirrored turns according to the method of image. The magnetic fields are then obtained from Ampere's Law and Biot-Savart Law. Up to 200 kHz, the difference of the proximity-effect resistance is less than 15% between calculation and measurement.\",","8489":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8490":"\"description-provenance\": [","8491":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-03T12:58:28Z (GMT).

For example, travelers may drive to a subway station and make a transfer to rail transit; alternatively, people may also start their trips by walking/cycling to a bus/subway station and then take transit in most of the trip. A successful eco-route planning thus should be able to cover multiple traffic modes and offer intermodal routing suggestions. Developing such a system requires to address extensive concerns. The dissertation is a building block of the multi-modal energy-efficient routing system which is being developed and tested in the simulation environment before real applications. Four submodules have been developed in the dissertation as partial fulfillment of the simulation-based systemenergy consumption modeling, subway system development, on-road vehicles dynamic eco-routing, and information effect on route choice behavior. Other submodules such as pedestrian/bicycle modeling will be studied in the future.   Towards the research goal, the dissertation first develops fuel consumption models for on-road vehicles. Given that gasoline light duty vehicles (LDVs) and electric vehicles were modeled in previous studies, the research effort mainly focuses on heavy duty vehicles (HDVs). Specifically, heavy duty diesel trucks (HDDTs) as well as diesel and hybrid-electric transit buses are modeled. The models are developed based on the Virginia Tech Comprehensive Power-based Fuel consumption Modeling (VT-CPFM) framework. The results demonstrate that the model estimates are highly consistent with field observations as well as the estimates of the Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model (CMEM) and MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES). It is also found that the optimum fuel economy cruise speed ranges between 32 and 52 km/h for the tested trucks and between 39 and 47 km/h for the tested buses on grades varying from 0% to 8%, which is significantly lower than LDVs (60-80 km/h).   The dissertation then models electric train dynamics and energy consumption in support of subway simulation system development and trip energy estimation. The dynamics model varies throttle and brake level with running speed rather than assuming constants as was done by previous studies, and the energy consumption model considers instantaneous energy regeneration. Both models can be easily calibrated using non-engine data and implemented in simulation systems and eco-transit applications. The results of the dynamics modeling demonstrate that the proposed model can adequately capture instantaneous acceleration/deceleration behavior and thus produce realistic train trajectories. The results of the energy consumption modeling demonstrate that the model produces the estimates consistent with the National Transit Database (NTD) results, and is applicable for project-level analysis given its ability in capturing the energy consumption differences associated with train, route and operational characteristics.   The most suitable simulation testbed for system development is then identified. The dissertation investigates four state-of-the-art microsimulation models (INTEGRATION, VISSIM, AIMSUM, PARAMICS). Given that the car-following model within a micro-simulator controls longitudinal vehicle motion and thus determines the resulting vehicle trajectories, the research effort mainly focuses on the performance of the built-in car-following models from the energy and environmental perspective. The vehicle specific power (VSP) distributions resulting from each of the car-following models are compared to the field observations. The results demonstrate that the Rakha-Pasumarthy-Adjerid (RPA) model (implemented in the INTEGRATION software) outperforms the Gipps (AIMSUM), Fritzsche (PARAMICS) and Wiedemann (VISSIM) models in generating accurate VSP distributions and fuel consumption and emission estimates. This demonstrates the advantage of the INTEGRATION model over the other three simulation models for energy and environmental analysis.   A new eco-routing model, comprehensively considering microscopic characteristics, is then developed, followed by a numerical experiment to test the benefit of the model. With the resulting eco-routing model, an on-road vehicle dynamic eco-routing system is constructed for in-vehicle navigation applications, and tested for different congestion levels. The results of the study demonstrate that the proposed eco-routing model is able to generate reasonable routing suggestions based on real-time information while at the same time differentiate eco-routes between vehicle models. It is also found that the proposed dynamic eco-routing system achieves lower network-wide energy consumption levels compared to the traditional eco-routing and travel time routing at all congestion levels. The results also demonstrate that the conventional fuel savings relative to the travel time routing decrease with the increasing congestion level; however, the electric power savings do not monotonically vary with congestion level. Furthermore, the energy savings relative to the traditional eco-routing are also not monotonically related to congestion level. In addition, network configuration is demonstrated to significantly affect eco-routing benefits.   The dissertation finally investigates the potential to influence driver behavior by studying the impact of information on route choice behavior based on a real world experiment. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the effectiveness of information in routing rationality depends upon the traveler's age, preferences, route characteristics, and information type. Specifically, information effect is less evident for elder travelers. Also, the provided information may not be contributing if travelers value other considerations or one route significantly outperforms the others. The results also demonstrate that, when travelers have limited experiences, strict information is more effective than variability information, and that the faster less reliable route is more attractive than the slower more reliable route; yet the difference becomes insignificant with experiences accumulation. The results of the study will be used to enhance system design through considering route choice incentives.\",","8583":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8584":"\"description-provenance\": [","8585":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-03T12:58:58Z (GMT).

Hence, this dissertation contributes to the areas of infrastructure innovation and P3s using a three pronged approach. First, exploration of the literature identified 348 factors that drive or inhibit innovation in infrastructure projects. These factors were synthesized into 33 aggregate factors such as client, integration, and risk. Subsequently, case interviews with practitioners revealed 110 factors that influence innovation in P3 projects; these were further grouped into six main categories. Literature and practitioner perspectives were strongly aligned around four predominant factors influencing innovation in P3 projectsi) risk, ii) client, iii) procurement, and iv) project type. Second, a framework to identify and classify project level innovation was derived and tested using deviations from project baselines submitted as alternative technical concepts (ATCs) in four infrastructure project procurements. The developed framework provides the infrastructure and construction community with a replicable approach to assess technical enhancements in projects to determine whether they are innovative or not and if so the type of innovation. Application of the framework classified only 7 of 53 ATCs from the four projects as innovative. However, the remainder added significant value through cost savings, improved safety or operational efficiency. Lastly, a case study of  six contemporary US highway P3 projectsi) Elizabeth River Tunnels in Virginia; ii) East End Crossing in Indiana; iii) North Tarrant Expressway segments 3A&B in Texas; iv) I-4 Ultimate Improvement in Florida; v) I-77 HOT Lanes in North Carolina; and vi) SH 288 Toll Lanes in Texas was conducted to determine the types of innovation found and to assess the influence of key project characteristics on P3 technical innovation. Technical enhancements proposed by concessionaires were assessed using project documentation and semi-structured interviews with 23 experienced public and private sector project participants. Innovations were uncovered, albeit limited. Procurement, project type, and payment mechanism (demand risk/traffic risk) were the key project characteristics influencing innovation.

Methods such as principal differential analysis, dynamic flux estimation, and others have been developed to overcome these challenges for ordinary differential equation models. Despite their advantages, these methods are still vastly underutilized in mathematical biology, and one potential reason for this is their sophisticated implementation. While this work focuses on applying principal differential analysis to microbiota data, we also provide comprehensive details regarding the derivation and numerics of this method. For further validation of the method, we demonstrate the feasibility of principal differential analysis using simulation studies and then apply the method to intestinal and vaginal microbiota data. In working with these data, we capture experimentally confirmed dynamics while also revealing potential new insights into those dynamics.

While extant storage systems are designed and tuned for a specific set of applications targeting a range of workload characteristics, they lack the flexibility in adapting to the ever-changing workload behaviors. Moreover, the complexities in implementing modern storage systems and adapting ever-changing storage requirements present unique opportunities and engineering challenges.  In this dissertation, we design and develop a series of novel data management and storage systems solutions by applying a simple yet effective rule---workload awareness. We find that simple workload-aware data management strategies are effective in improving the efficiency of modern storage systems, sometimes by an order of magnitude.  The first two works tackle the data management and storage space allocation issues at distributed and cloud storage level, while the third work focuses on low-level data management problems in the local storage system, which many high-level storage/data-intensive applications rely on.  In the first part of this dissertation (Chapter~ref{ch:mbal}), we propose and develop MBal, a high-performance in-memory object caching framework with adaptive multi-phase load balancing, which supports not only horizontal (scale-out) but vertical (scale-up) scalability as well. MBal is able to make efficient use of available resources in the cloud through its fine-grained, partitioned, lockless design. In the second part of this dissertation (Chapter~ref{ch:cast} and Chapter~ref{ch:pricing}), we design and build CAST (Chapter~ref{ch:cast}), a Cloud Analytics Storage Tiering solution that cloud tenants can use to reduce monetary cost and improve performance of analytics workloads. The approach takes the first step towards providing storage tiering support for data analytics in the cloud.  Furthermore, we propose a hybrid cloud object storage system (Chapter~ref{ch:pricing}) that could effectively engage both the cloud service providers and cloud tenants via a novel dynamic pricing mechanism. In the third part of this dissertation (Chapter~ref{ch:offline}), targeting local storage, we explore offline algorithms for flash caching in terms of both hit ratio and flash lifespan. We design and implement a multi-stage heuristic by synthesizing several techniques that manage data at the granularity of a flash erasure unit (which we call a container) to approximate the offline optimal algorithm.  In the fourth part of this dissertation (Chapter~ref{ch:turnkey}), we are focused on how to enable fast prototyping of efficient distributed key-value stores targeting a proxy-based layered architecture. In this work, we design and build {con}, a framework that significantly reduce the engineering effort required to build a full-fledged distributed key-value store.  Our dissertation shows that simple workload-aware data management strategies can bring huge benefit in terms of both efficiency (i.e., performance, monetary cost, etc.) and flexibility (i.e., ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, programmability, etc.). The principles of leveraging workload dynamicity and storage heterogeneity can be used to guide next-generation storage system software design, especially when being faced with new storage hardware technologies.\",","8783":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8784":"\"description-provenance\": [","8785":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-08T08:00:16Z (GMT).

The quality of the final part, including the geometric integrity and surface finish, is highly dependent upon the broaching tool condition. Though there has been a considerable amount of research on tool condition monitoring and prognostics for various machining processes, the broaching process is unique in the following aspects1) a broaching process involves multiple cutting edges, which jointly contribute to the final part quality; 2) the resharpening and any other process adjustments to the tool can only be performed with the whole broaching tool or at least a whole segment of the tool replaced.   The overarching goal of this research is to explore how engineering knowledge can be used to improve process monitoring and prognostics for a complex manufacturing process like broaching. This dissertation addresses the needs for developing new monitoring and prognostics approaches based on various types of data. Specifically, the research effort focuses on 1) the use of in-situ force profile data for real-time process monitoring and fault diagnosis, 2) degradation characterization for broaching processes on an individual component level based on image processing; and 3) system-level degradation modeling and remaining useful life prediction for broaching processes based on multiple images.\",","8831":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8832":"\"description-provenance\": [","8833":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-08T08:00:39Z (GMT).

One the other hand, it is becoming more and more difficult for existing tools to handle massive datasets with various data types.  This thesis presents the attempts to address the challenges and solve different security problems by mining security risks from massive datasets. The attempts are in three aspectsdetecting security risks in the enterprise environment, prioritizing security risks of mobile apps and measuring the impact of security risks between websites and mobile apps. First, the thesis presents a framework to detect data leakage in very large content. The framework can be deployed on cloud for enterprise and preserve the privacy of sensitive data. Second, the thesis prioritizes the inter-app communication risks in large-scale Android apps by designing new distributed inter-app communication linking algorithm and performing nearest-neighbor risk analysis. Third, the thesis measures the impact of deep link hijacking risk, which is one type of inter-app communication risks, on 1 million websites and 160 thousand mobile apps.

The first and second chapters are related to economics of immigration, and the last one is about environmental economics. The first chapter studies people who work and live in the US on work visas such as H-1B, and compares them to natives. In this chapter I examine whether or not there exists any wage premium for or against college graduate immigrants who are on work visa compared to college graduate natives. I also check for any change of such a premium from 2003 to 2010. On the contrary to the common belief that foreign workers are cheap labor force, my results show that skilled immigrants holding temporary work visas on average have a significant wage premium over natives, and this premium has even increased significantly from 2003 to 2010 (from 14% to 22%). My results show that such a wage premium is different for men, women, and countries of origin, but I found no evidence supporting different premiums across different fields of study.  The second chapter of this dissertation studies the dynamics of the earnings gap between those immigrants and US-born individuals with bachelor's degrees or higher in science and engineering fields. The research question is that in case a gap exists for or against immigrants, how is it changing with the amount of time immigrants reside in the United States? I employ cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches to answer this question, and study the earnings gap between three groups of immigrants (based on the current residency status) and natives at entry and over time. I also compare natives with immigrants who migrated to the United States on different types of visas (permanent residence visa, work visa, study visa, and dependent visa). Results show that, upon arrival, immigrants on average have a considerable premium over the US-born, and this gap, surprisingly, even gets bigger with an approximate rate of 0.25% for the first 5-10 years of immigrants' residence in the US. This phenomenon could be due to the higher level of abilities and motivation among immigrants compared to natives. Another reason can be the selectivity among immigrants, meaning that more successful stays and others return. Unfortunately, due to the lack of information in data regarding these issues, they could not be controlled for in my models.  The last chapter is about environmental economics. This chapter exploits a daily time series data on pollen count and PM2:5 level from 2009 to 2015 to study the separate impacts of PM2:5 and pollen on the number of total, in-patient, and out-patient respiratory hospital admissions within different age groups in the Reno/Sparks metropolitan area in Northern Nevada. The results show that although PM2:5 has a positive impact on the number of out- patient admissions in most of the age groups, there is no evidence that shows any relationship between the pollen count and the number of in-patient or out-patient respiratory admissions.\",","8928":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","8929":"\"description-provenance\": [","8930":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-11T08:00:30Z (GMT).

This thesis is built on three main components. At first, we target bilinear and quadratic form estimation. Bilinear form $c^TA^{-1}b$ is often associated with long sequences of linear systems, especially in optimization problems. Thus, we devise algorithms that adapt cheap bilinear and quadratic form estimates for Krylov subspace recycling. In the second part, we develop a hybrid recycling method that is inspired by a complex CFD application. We aim to make the method robust and cheap at the same time. In the third part of the thesis, we optimize the implementation of Krylov subspace methods on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs).

Lupus nephritis (LN) as the manifestation in the kidney occurs in more than 50% of SLE patients and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Current treatments consist of immunosuppressants that always lead to compromised immune responses with increased risks of infections as the major side effect. To minimize this side effect, it is crucial to develop new treatments that are more natural and specific.     Vitamin A, particularly in the form of its functional metabolite, retinoic acid, has shown some beneficial effects against LN in both lupus-prone mouse models and clinical cases. However, a more systemic evaluation of vitamin A treatment in lupus had not been investigated. In our study, we found paradoxical effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (tRA) on lupus-like disease in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice. Starting at 6 weeks old when the inflammatory environment had been established in MRL/lpr mice, tRA administration reduced immune cell numbers in the secondary lymphoid organs and improved glomerulonephritis. However, circulating autoantibodies and inflammation in renal tubulointerstitium and other organs were increased. The detrimental effects of tRA were not present in MRL control mice, which didn't have an established inflammatory environment at 6 weeks old as shown in MRL/lpr mice, suggesting that the pro-inflammatory effects of tRA are dependent on the pre-existing inflammatory environment. Therefore, to successfully apply vitamin A-based treatment, it is important to avoid the detrimental effects of tRA on lupus by identifying and then specifically eliminating the critical pro-inflammatory immune cell types in lupus. As treatments usually start after the onset of apparent symptoms in patients at the effector stage of autoimmune responses, targeting the inflammatory contributors at this stage appears to be more practical and critical.     Among different types of leukocytes, we chose to focus on dendritic cells (DCs), because they are highly diverse and critical in the immune responses as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) as a candidate target have been demonstrated to be crucial for the initiation of lupus development by producing IFN\u03b1. However, we demonstrated that although pDCs produced a large amount of IFN\u03b1 during disease initiation, those from late-stage lupus mice were found to be defective in producing IFN\u03b1, suggesting that pDC-targeted treatments should be performed at the initiation stage. This will depend on the progress in early diagnosis in the future. Besides pDCs, we identified a CD11c+ cell population absent at the early-stage but gradually accumulating at the late-stage in the kidneys of lupus mice. These cells have a phenotype of mature monocyte-derived DCs, with particularly high CX3CR1 expression on the surface. Consistent with their pathogenic cytokine profile, in vivo administration of anti-CX3CR1-saporin conjugates to dysfunction these cells in MRL/lpr mice significantly reduced proteinuria scores. Ex vivo activation of renal-infiltrating CD4+ T cells showed increased survival rate, proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 production of activated CD4+ T cells when they were cultured with these renal-infiltrating CD11c+ cells. These results suggest that the renal-infiltrating CD11c+ cells are pathogenic and promote inflammation in the kidney at the later effector stage of lupus by interacting with renal-infiltrating CD4+ T cells.     In conclusion, although vitamin A showed anti-inflammatory effects on reducing glomerulonephritis, its use in lupus treatment should be guarded due to the other potential pro-inflammatory effects induced by the pre-existing inflammatory environment. IFN\u03b1-producing pDCs and CX3CR1highCD11c+ monocyte-derived DCs could be specific therapeutic targets to reduce the established inflammation at the early stage and late stage of LN, respectively. Therefore, it is worthwhile to further investigate the comprehensive effects of combination therapy on lupus, with vitamin A administration and pDCs-specific depletion at the early stage, and CX3CR1highCD11c+ monocyte-derived DCs-specific depletion at the late stage.\",","9022":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9023":"\"description-provenance\": [","9024":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-11T08:00:48Z (GMT).

The localization of indoor footsteps can yield several benefits in areas such as security and threat detection, emergency response and evacuation, and building resource management, to name a few. The work described herein seeks to provide supplementary information to better define the problem of indoor footstep localization, and to investigate the use of several localization techniques in a real-world, operational building environment. The complexities of locating footsteps via indoor vibration measurements are discussed from a mechanics perspective using prior literature, and several techniques developed for localization in plate structures are considered for their applicability to indoor localization. A dispersion compensation tool is experimentally investigated for localization in an instrumented building. A machine learning approach is also explored using a nearest neighbor search. Additionally, a novel instrumentation method is designed based on a multi-point coupling approach that provides directional inference from a single point of measurement.

This research addresses two different employee scheduling applications using multi-criteria objectives that present decision makers with trade-offs between global optimality and the level of disruption to current operating resources. Additionally, it investigates a scheduling problem from the product testing domain and proposes a heuristic solution technique for the problem that is shown to produce very high-quality solutions in short amounts of time. Chapter 2 addresses a grant administration workload-to-staff assignment problem that occurs in the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs at land-grant universities. We identify the optimal workload assignment plan which differs considerably due to multiple reassignments from the current state. To achieve the optimal workload reassignment plan we demonstrate a technique to identify the n best reassignments from the current state that provides the greatest progress toward the utopian solution. Solving this problem over several values of n and plotting the results allows the decision maker to visualize the reassignments and the progress achieved toward the utopian balanced workload solution.  Chapter 3 identifies a weekly schedule that seeks the most cost-effective set of coach-to-program assignments in a gymnastics facility. We identify the optimal assignment plan using an integer linear programming model. The optimal assignment plan differs greatly from the status quo; therefore, we utilize a similar approach from Chapter 2 and use a multiple objective optimization technique to identify the n best staff reassignments. Again, the decision maker can visualize the trade-off between the number of reassignments and the resulting progress toward the utopian staffing cost solution and make an informed decision about the best number of reassignments. Chapter 4 focuses on product test scheduling in the presence of in-process and at-completion inspection constraints. Such testing arises in the context of the manufacture of products that must perform reliably in extreme environmental conditions. Each product receives a certification at the successful completion of a predetermined series of tests. Operational efficiency is enhanced by determining the optimal order and start times of tests so as to minimize the make span while ensuring that technicians are available when needed to complete in-process and at-completion inspections We first formulate a mixed-integer programming model (MILP) to identify the optimal solution to this problem using IBM ILOG CPLEX Interactive Optimizer 12.7.

This research utilizes atomistic scale modeling to study nanoscale deformation phenomena with time and spatial resolution not available in experimental testing.  Molecular dynamics techniques are used to understand plastic deformation of grain boundaries and surfaces in metals under different configurations and loading procedures. Stress and strain localization phenomena are investigated at plastically deformed boundaries in axially strain thin film samples. Joint experimental and modelling work showed increased stress states at the intersections of slip planes and grain boundaries. This effect, as well as several other differences related to stress and strain localization are thoroughly examined in digital samples with two different grain boundary relaxation states. It is found that localized stress and strain is exacerbated by initial boundary disorder.  Dislocation content in the randomly generated boundaries of these samples was quantified via the dislocation extraction algorithm. Significant numbers of lattice dislocations were present in both deformed and undeformed samples. Trends in dislocation content during straining were identified for individual samples and boundaries but were not consistent across all examples. The various contributions to dislocation content and the implications on material behavior are discussed.  The effects of grain boundary hydrogen on the deformation response of a digital Ni polycrystalline thin film sample is reported. H content is found to change the structure of the boundaries and effect dislocation emission. The presence of dispersed hydrogen caused a slight increase in yield strength, followed by an increase in grain boundary dislocation emission and an increase in grain boundary crack formation and growth.  An atomistic nano indenter is employed to study the nanoscale contact behavior of the indenter-surface interface during nano-indentation. Several indentation simulations are executed with different interatomic potentials and different indenter orientations. A surface structure is identified that forms consistently regardless of these variables. This structure is found to affect several atomic layers of the sample. The implications of this effect on the onset of plasticity are discussed.  Finally, the implementation of an elastic/plastic continuum contact solution for use in mesoscale molecular dynamics simulations of solid spheres is discussed. The contact model improves on previous models for the forces response of colliding spheres by accounting for a plastic regime after the point of yield. The specifics of the model and its implementation are given in detail.  Overall, the dissertation presents insights into basic plastic deformation phenomena using a combination of experiment and theory.  Despite the limitations of atomistic techniques, current computational power allows meaningful comparison with experiments.\",","9163":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9164":"\"description-provenance\": [","9165":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-16T08:00:24Z (GMT).

The first essay (Chapter 1) examines whether high CEO pay inequality (CPI), the share of total managerial pay captured by the CEO, is an outcome of poor corporate governance, and its implications for shareholder wealth. We exploit the 2002 NYSE and NASDAQ governance reforms that mandated firms to have majority independent boards as a quasi-exogenous source of variation in the internal governance environment of firms. Results show that CPI decreases following the passage of these exchange listing regulations, but only in firms with entrenched CEOs affected by the exchange listing regulations. Firm value also increases for these firms. These results are robust to a variety of robustness checks such as a matched sample analysis and placebo tests. Overall, our results suggest that poor governance environments are associated with high managerial pay differences and consequently lower firm valuations, supporting the view that high CEO pay inequality reflects managerial entrenchment.  The second essay (Chapter 2) examines whether shareholders use executive compensation channel to align managerial horizon with their investment horizon. We utilize a newly emerged empirical measure, pay duration, to measure managerial horizon. For shareholder horizon, we use the fraction of long-term institutional ownership in the firm. Results show that there is a positive association between long-term institutional ownership and CEO pay duration, suggesting that shareholder horizon is a determining factor in compensation contracts. We address reverse causality using indexer institutions. We also establish a causal link from investor horizon to CEO pay duration using institution mergers as a source of exogenous variation in investor horizon of the firm. We extend our results to hedge fund activism and document a negative relation between hedge fund activism and pay duration, which is consistent with our argument. Overall our results suggest that shareholders structure CEO pay in a way that is consistent with their investment horizon.\",","9210":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9211":"\"description-provenance\": [","9212":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-16T08:00:46Z (GMT).

However, the inherent complexity of advanced manufacturing, including nonlinear process dynamics, multiple process attributes, and low signal/noise ratio, poses severe challenges for both maintaining stable process operations and establishing efficacious online quality assurance schemes.  To address these challenges, four different advanced manufacturing processes, namely, fused filament fabrication (FFF), binder jetting, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), and the slicing process in wafer production, are investigated in this dissertation for applications of online quality assurance, with utilization of various sensors, such as thermocouples, infrared temperature sensors, accelerometers, etc. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to develop innovative integrated methodologies tailored for these individual manufacturing processes but addressing their common challenges to achieve satisfying performance in online quality assurance based on heterogeneous sensor data. Specifically, three new methodologies are created and validated using actual sensor data, namely,  (1) Real-time process monitoring methods using Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model for timely detection of process changes and identification of different process states for FFF and CMP. The proposed methodology is capable of tackling non-Gaussian data from heterogeneous sensors in these advanced manufacturing processes for successful online quality assurance.  (2) Spatial Dirichlet process (SDP) for modeling complex multimodal wafer thickness profiles and exploring their clustering effects. The SDP-based statistical control scheme can effectively detect out-of-control wafers and achieve wafer thickness quality assurance for the slicing process with high accuracy.  (3) Augmented spatiotemporal log Gaussian Cox process (AST-LGCP) quantifying the spatiotemporal evolution of porosity in binder jetting parts, capable of predicting high-risk areas on consecutive layers. This work fills the long-standing research gap of lacking rigorous layer-wise porosity quantification for parts made by additive manufacturing (AM), and provides the basis for facilitating corrective actions for product quality improvements in a prognostic way.

Advancement of gasification technologies may be expedited through the use of computational fluid dynamics, as virtual reactor design offers a low cost method for system prototyping. To that end, a series of numerical studies were conducted to identify a computational modeling strategy for the simulation of coal gasification in fluidized bed reactors. The efforts set forth by this work first involved the development of a validatable hydrodynamic modeling strategy for the simulation of sand and coal fluidization. Those fluidization models were then applied to systems at elevated temperatures and polydisperse systems that featured a complex material injection geometry, for which no experimental data exists. A method for establishing similitude between 2-D and 3-D multiphase systems that feature non-symmetric material injection were then delineated and numerically tested. Following the development of the hydrodynamic modeling strategy, simulations of coal gasification were conducted using three different chemistry models. Simulated results were compared to experimental outcomes in an effort to assess the validity of each gasification chemistry model. The chemistry model that exhibited the highest degree of agreement with the experimental findings was then further analyzed identify areas of potential improvement.\",","9354":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9355":"\"description-provenance\": [","9356":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-25T08:00:21Z (GMT).

We have mainly discussed two major cardiac signalselectrocardiogram (ECG), and  photoplethysmogram (PPG).  ECG and PPG signals hold strong potential for biometric authentications and identifications. We have shown that by mapping each cardiac beat from time domain to an angular domain using a limit cycle, intra-class variability can be significantly minimized. This is in contrary to conventional time domain analysis. Our experiments with both ECG and PPG signal shows that the proposed method eliminates the effect of instantaneous heart rate on the shape morphology and improves authentication accuracy. For noninvasive measurement of PPG beats, we have developed a systematic algorithm to extract pulse rate from face video in diverse situations using video magnification. We have extracted signals from skin patches and then used frequency domain correlation to filter out non-cardiac signals. We have developed a novel entropy based method to automatically select skin patches from face. We report beat-to-beat accuracy of remote PPG (rPPG) in comparison to conventional average heart rate. The beat-to-beat accuracy is required for applications related to heart rate variability (HRV) and affective computing. The algorithm has been tested on two datasets, one with static illumination condition and the other with unrestricted ambient illumination condition.  Automatic skin detection is an intermediate step for rPPG. Existing methods always depend on color information to detect human skin. We have developed a novel standalone skin detection method to show that it is not  necessary to have color cues for skin detection. We have used LBP lacunarity based micro-textures features and a region growing algorithm to find skin pixels in an image. Our experiment shows that the proposed method is applicable universally to any image including near infra-red images. This finding helps to extend the domain of many application including rPPG. To the best of our knowledge, this is first such method that is independent of color cues.\",","9401":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9402":"\"description-provenance\": [","9403":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-26T08:00:18Z (GMT).

To have a broad impact on the communities in education and to serve for a long period, DLs need to structure and organize the resources in a way that facilitates the dissemination and the reuse of resources. Such a digital library should meet defined quality dimensions in the 5S (Societies, Scenarios, Spaces, Structures, Streams) framework - including completeness, consistency, efficiency, extensibility, and reliability - to ensure that a good quality DL is built.  In this research, we addressed both external and internal quality aspects of DLs. For internal qualities, we focused on completeness and consistency of the collection, catalog, and repository. We developed an application pipeline to acquire user-generated computing-related resources from YouTube and SlideShare for an educational DL. We applied machine learning techniques to transfer what we learned from the ACM Digital Library dataset. We built classifiers to catalog resources according to the ACM Computing Classification System from the two new domains that were evaluated using Amazon Mechanical Turk. For external qualities, we focused on efficiency, scalability, and reliability in DL services. We proposed cloud-based designs and applications to ensure and improve these qualities in DL services using cloud computing. The experimental results show that our proposed methods are promising for enhancing and enriching an educational digital library.

Verification and validation (V and V) of such models is an inherent and fundamental challenge. Central to V and V, but also to model analysis and prediction, are uncertainty quantification (UQ), sensitivity analysis (SA) and design of experiments (DOE). In addition, network-based computer simulation models, as compared with models based on ordinary and partial differential equations (ODE and PDE), typically involve a significantly larger volume of more complex data. Efficient use of such models is challenging since it requires a broad set of skills ranging from domain expertise to in-depth knowledge including modeling, programming, algorithmics, high- performance computing, statistical analysis, and optimization. On top of this, the need to support reproducible experiments necessitates complete data tracking and management. Finally, the lack of standardization of simulation model configuration formats presents an extra challenge when developing technology intended to work across models. While there are tools and frameworks that address parts of the challenges above, to the best of our knowledge, none of them accomplishes all this in a model-independent and scientifically reproducible manner.  In this dissertation, we present a computational framework called GENEUS that addresses these challenges. Specifically, it incorporates (i) a standardized model configuration format, (ii) a data flow management system with digital library functions helping to ensure scientific reproducibility, and (iii) a model-independent, expandable plugin-type library for efficiently conducting UQ/SA/DOE for network-based simulation models. This framework has been applied to systems ranging from fundamental graph dynamical systems (GDSs) to large-scale socio-technical simulation models with a broad range of analyses such as UQ and parameter studies for various scenarios. Graph dynamical systems provide a theoretical framework for network-based simulation models and have been studied theoretically in this dissertation. This includes a broad range of stability and sensitivity analyses offering insights into how GDSs respond to perturbations of their key components. This stability-focused, structure-to-function theory was a motivator for the design and implementation of GENEUS.  GENEUS, rooted in the framework of GDS, provides modelers, experimentalists, and research groups access to a variety of UQ/SA/DOE methods with robust and tested implementations without requiring them to necessarily have the detailed expertise in statistics, data management and computing. Even for research teams having all the skills, GENEUS can significantly increase research productivity.\",","9504":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9505":"\"description-provenance\": [","9506":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-30T08:00:19Z (GMT).

Damage development in composite materials is more complex than for metallic materials, because in composite materials (a) multiple damage modes are simultaneously in play, and (b) individual 'damage events' that occur throughout a component's service life may neither noticeably affect its performance, nor suggest future failure. Therefore, informed health monitoring of composite components must include monitoring and analysis of their health state throughout their service life.  A crucial aspect of the health monitoring process of composites is the development of tools to help with this goal of understanding the health state of composites throughout their life. This knowledge can lead to timely anticipation of future failure in composite components, and advance the state of current technology. One, timely maintenance can be planned in advance. Two, each component's service life can be determined based on its individual health information, rather than empirical statistics of previously failed components. This dissertation develops such tools and methods.  Composite specimens of multiple ply-layups are subjected to tensile loading schemes until failure. Pencil Lead Breaks (PLBs) are used to simulate Acoustic Emission sources and generate acoustic waves that are acquired by installed piezoelectric sensors. A numerical method to estimate the arrival of wave modes from ultrasonic signals is presented. Methods are also presented that utilize PLB signals to indicate approaching failure of specimens under monotonic as well as cyclic loading. These processes have been developed prioritizing simplicity and ease-of-execution, to be adapted for practical deployment.\",","9550":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9551":"\"description-provenance\": [","9552":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-30T08:00:40Z (GMT).

As an alternative to conventional commercially available SHM techniques, the current work explores processing-structure-property relationships starting from carbon nanotube (CNT) based nanocomposites to particulate composites with nanocomposite binder/matrix materials, i.e. hybrid particulate composites to investigate deformation and damage sensing capabilities of inherently sensing materials and structures through their piezoresistive (coupled electro-mechanical) response. Initial efforts focused on controlling the dispersion of CNTs and orientation of CNT filaments within nanocomposites under dielectrophoresis to guide design and fabrication process of nanocomposites by tuning CNT concentration, applied AC electric field intensity, frequency and exposure time. It is observed that a combination of exposure time to AC electric field and the AC field frequency are the key drivers of filament width and spacing and that the network for filament formation is much more efficient for pristine CNTs than for acid treated functionalized CNTs. With the knowledge obtained from controlling the morphological features, AC field-induced long range alignment of CNTs within bulk nanocomposites was scaled up to form structural test coupons. The morphology, electrical and mechanical properties of the coupons were investigated. The anisotropic piezoresistive response both for parallel and transverse to CNT alignment direction within bulk composite coupons under various loading conditions was obtained. It is observed that control of the CNT network allows for the establishment of percolation paths and piezoresistive response well below the nominal percolation threshold observed for random, so called well-dispersed CNT network distributions. The potential for use of such bulk nanocomposites in SHM applications to detect strain and microdamage accumulation is further demonstrated, underscoring the importance of microscale CNT distribution/orientation and network formation/disruption in governing the piezoresistive sensitivities. Finally, what may be the first experimental study in the literature is conducted for real-time embedded microscale strain and damage sensing in energetic materials by distributing the CNT sensing network throughout the binder phase of inert and mock energetic composites through piezoresistive response for SHM in energetic materials. The incorporation of CNTs into inert and mock energetic composites revealed promising self-diagnostic functionalities for in situ real-time SHM applications under quasi-static and low velocity impact loading for solid rocket propellants, detonators and munitions to reduce the stochastic nature of safety characterization and help in designing insult tolerant energetic materials.\",","9593":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9594":"\"description-provenance\": [","9595":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-31T16:00:39Z (GMT).

The sample consisted of 10 participants at a single women's college in the southern region of the United States who had completed at least 60 credit hours at the institution and were enrolled as full-time residential students.  Data were collected through a series of three interviews conducted with participants and reflection essays authored by participants.    Study participants described the women's college classroom environment as a place where professors encouraged student participation in classroom discussions and where students could voice ideas, experiences, and uncertainties in an accepting space.  The women's college students in this study indicated they received individual reaffirmation and intellectual validation from professors and peers, and over time became more likely to take risks with their thinking, aloud, in the classroom environment.  Study participants made meaning from their classroom experience by actively reflecting on how these experiences fostered personal growth, comparing lived experiences to preconceptions, and imagining how their undergraduate experience would have been different had they chosen to attend a coeducational college.\",","9647":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9648":"\"description-provenance\": [","9649":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-01T08:00:24Z (GMT).

MSC fate and function is determined by microenvironmental cues, specifically dimensionality, topography, and cell-cell interactions. MSC responses of migration and differentiation are the focus of this dissertation. Cell migration occurs in several physiological and pathological processes; migration mode and cell signaling are determined by the environment and type of confinement in three-dimensional (3D) models.     Tendon injury is a common musculoskeletal disorder that occurs through cumulative damage to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Studies combining nanofibrous scaffolds and MSCs to determine an optimal topographical environment have promoted tenogenic differentiation under various conditions. We investigated cellular response of MSCs on specifically designed nanofiber matrices fabricated using a novel spinneret-based tunable engineered parameters production method (STEP). We designed suspended and aligned nanofiber scaffolds to study cellular morphology, tendon marker gene expression, and matrix deposition as determinants for tendon differentiation.     The delivery and maintenance of MSCs at sites of inflammation or injury are major challenges in stem cell therapies. Enhancing stem cell homing could improve their therapeutic effects. Homing is a process that involves cell migration through the vasculature to target organs. This process is defined in leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM); however, far less is known about MSC homing. We investigated two population subsets of MSCs in a Transwell system mimicking the vasculature; migrated cells that initiated transmigration on the endothelium and nonmigrated cells in the apical chamber that failed to transmigrate. Gene and protein expression changes were observed between these subsets and evidence suggests that multiple signaling pathways regulate TEM.     The results of these experiments have demonstrated that microenvironmental cues are critical to understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of MSC response, specifically in homing and differentiation. This knowledge has identified scaffold parameters required to stimulate tenogenesis and signaling pathways controlling MSC homing. These findings will allow us to target key regulatory molecules and cell signaling pathways involved in MSC response towards development of regenerative therapies.\",","9690":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9691":"\"description-provenance\": [","9692":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-01T08:00:51Z (GMT).

Peridynamics, a non-local continuum theory which was originally formulated for modeling problems in solid mechanics, has been extended in this research to electromechanical fields and applied to study the electromechanical properties of CNT nanocomposites at multiple length scales.   Piezoresistivity is the coupling between the electrical properties of a material and applied mechanical loads, more specifically the change in resistance in response to deformation. This can include both, a geometric effect due to change in dimensions as well as the change in resistivity of the material itself. Nanocomposites referred to in this work are materials which consist of CNTs dispersed in a binding polymer matrix. The origins of the extraordinary piezoresistive properties of nanocomposites lie at the nanoscale where the non-local phenomenon of electron hopping plays a significant role in establishing the properties of the nanocomposite along with CNT network formation and inherent piezoresistivity of CNTs themselves. Electron hopping or tunneling allows for a current to flow between neighboring CNTs even when they are not in contact, provided the energy barrier for electrons to hop is small enough. This phenomenon is highly nonlinear with respect to the intertube distance and is also dependent on other factors such as the potential barrier of the polymer matrix.   To investigate this in more detail, peridynamic simulations are first employed to study the piezoresistivity at the CNT bundle scale by considering a nanoscale representative volume element (RVE) of CNTs within polymer matrix, and by explicitly modeling electron hopping effects. This is done by introducing electron hopping bonds and it is shown that the conductivity and the non-local length scale parameter in peridynamics (the horizon) can be derived from a purely physics based model rather than assuming an ad-hoc value.   Piezoresistivity can be characterized as a function of the deformation and damage within the material and thereby used as an in-situ indicator of the structural health of the material. As such, a material system for which real time in-situ monitoring may be useful is polymer bonded explosives. While these materials are designed for detonation under conditions of a strong shock, they can be damaged or even ignited under certain low magnitude impact scenarios such as during accidental drop or transportation. Since these materials are a heterogeneous system consisting of explosive grains within a polymer matrix binder, it is proposed that CNTs can be dispersed within the binder medium leading to an inherently piezoresistive hybrid nanocomposite bonded explosive material (NCBX) material which can then be monitored for a continuous assessment of deformation and damage within the material.   To explore the potential use of CNT nanocomposites for this novel application, peridynamic simulations are carried out at the microscale level, first under quasistatic conditions and subsequently under dynamic conditions to allow the propagation of elastic waves. Peridynamics equations, which can be discretized to obtain a meshless method are particularly suited to this problem as the explicit modeling of crack initiation and propagation at the microscale is essential to understanding the properties of this material. Moreover, many other parameters such as electrical conductivity of the grain and the properties of the grain-binder interface are studied to understand their effect on the piezoresistive response of the material. For example, it is found that conductivity of the grain plays a major role in the piezoresistive response since it affects the preferential pathways of current density depending on the relative ease of flow through grain vs. binder.  The results of this work are promising and are two fold. Peridynamics is found to be an effective method to model such materials, both at the nanoscale and the microscale. It alleviates some of difficulties faced by traditional finite element methods in the modeling of damage in materials and can be extended to coupled fields with relative ease. Secondly, simulations presented in this work show that there is much promise in this novel application of nanocomposites in the field of structural health monitoring of polymer bonded explosives.\",","9737":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9738":"\"description-provenance\": [","9739":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-06T08:00:41Z (GMT).

Both methods have been studied and analyzed as individual techniques as well as a coupled approach to pursue better understandings of the mechanisms and interactions between turbulent flow and mixing, ignition behavior and pollutant formation. A thorough analysis and comparison of both turbulence models and chemistry representation methods was executed and simulations were compared and validated with experimental works. An extensive study of turbulence modeling methods, and the optimization of modeling techniques including turbulence intensity and computational domain size have been conducted. The final CFD model has demonstrated good predictive performance for different turbulent bluff-body flames. The NOx formation and the effects of fuel mixtures indicated that the addition of hydrogen to the fuel and non-flammable diluents like CO2 and H2O contribute to the reduction of NOx.    The second part of the study focused on developing chemical models and methods that include the detailed gaseous reaction mechanism of GRI-Mech 3.0 but cost less computational time. A new chemical reactor network has been created based on the CFD results of combustion characteristics and flow fields. The proposed CRN has been validated with the temperature and species emission for different bluff-body flames and has shown the capability of being applied to general bluff-body systems. Specifically, the rate of production of NOx and the sensitivity analysis based on the CRN results helped to summarize the reduced reaction mechanism, which not only provided a promising method to generate representative reactions from hundreds of species and reactions in gaseous mechanism but also presented valuable information of the combustion mechanisms and NOx formation. Finally, the proposed reduced reaction mechanism from the sensitivity analysis was applied to the CFD simulations, which created a fully coupled process between CFD and CRN, and the results from the reduced reaction mechanism have shown good predictions compared with the probability density function method.\",","9783":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9784":"\"description-provenance\": [","9785":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-06T08:00:48Z (GMT).

GBM is considered incurable with even the most aggressive multimodal therapies and is characterized by near universal recurrence. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a cellular ablation method currently being investigated as a therapy for a variety of cancers. Application of IRE involves insertion of electrodes into tissue to deliver pulsed electric fields (PEFs), which destabilize the cell membrane past the point of recovery, thereby inducing cell death. While this treatment modality has numerous advantages, the lack of selectivity for malignant cells limits its application in the brain where damage to healthy tissue is especially deleterious. In this dissertation we hypothesize that a form of IRE therapy, high-frequency IRE (H-FIRE), may be able to act as a selective targeted therapy for GBM due to its ability to create an electric field inside a cell to interact with altered inner organelles. Through a comprehensive investigation involving experimental testing combined with numerical modeling, we have attained results in strong support of this hypothesis. Using tissue engineered hydrogels as our platform for therapy testing, we demonstrate selective ablation of GBM cells. We develop mathematical models that predict the majority of the electric field produced by H-FIRE pulses reach the inside of the cell. We demonstrate that the increased nuclear to cytoplasm ratio (NCR) of malignant GBM cells compared to healthy brain\ufffd\\"evidenced in vivo and in in vitro tissue mimics\ufffd\\"is correlated with greater ablation volumes and thus lower electric field thresholds for cell death when treated with H-FIRE. We enhance the selectivity achieved with H-FIRE using a molecularly targeted drug that induces an increase in NCR.  We tune the treatment pulse parameters to increase selective malignant cell killing. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of H-FIRE to ablate therapy-resistant GBM cells which are a focus of many next-generation GBM therapies. We believe the evidence presented in this dissertation represents the beginning stages in the development of H-FIRE as a selective therapy to be used for treatment of human brain cancer.\",","9829":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9830":"\"description-provenance\": [","9831":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-06T08:01:06Z (GMT).

In the early 2000s, 78% of injuries were attributable to an explosive mechanism during overseas conflicts, which has led to increased incidences of BINT [1a]. Clinical manifestations of BINT include long-term psychological impairments, which are driven by the underlying cellular and molecular sequelae of the injury. Development of effective treatment strategies is limited by the lack of understanding on the cellular and molecular level [2a]. The overall hypothesis of this work is that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms contribute to the progression of the BINT pathology and neurological impairments. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, are important processes by which cells coordinate neurological and cellular response to environmental stimuli. To date, the role of epigenetics in BINT remains largely unknown. To test this hypothesis, an established rodent model of BINT was employed [3a]. Analysis of DNA methylation, which is involved in memory processes, showed decreased levels one week following injury, which was accompanied by decreased expression of the enzyme responsible for facilitating the addition of methyl groups to DNA. The one week time point also showed dramatic decreases in histone acetylation which correlated to decline in memory. This change was observed in astrocytes and may provide a mechanistic understanding for a hallmark characteristic of the injury. Treatment with a specific enzyme inhibitor was able to mitigate some of the histone acetylation changes. This corresponded with reduced astrocyte activation and an altered behavioral phenotype, which was characterized by high response to novelty. The diagnostic efficacy of epigenetic changes following blast was elucidated by the accumulation of cell-free nucleic acids in cerebrospinal fluid one month after injury. Concentrations of these molecules shows promise in discriminating between injured and non-injured individuals.  To date, the diagnostic and therapeutic efforts of BINT have been limited by the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the injury. This work provides novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The clinical potential impact on diagnosis and therapeutic intervention has been demonstrated.\",","9878":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9879":"\"description-provenance\": [","9880":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-07T08:00:19Z (GMT).

This ambiguity in description becomes more prominent when the designer has to make sense of the fabric remotely, such as shopping online.  This ambiguity in description presets an opportunity to study user interface design that supports, rather than diminishes, the role of ambiguity, which is often a resource in design domains. Our most important research question wasHow can we design interfaces with standard interface toolkits to help designers explore and understand material remotely?  For our approach, we studied how people described distinct fabrics, from experts, novices, to everyday people and the crowdsourcing community on how they interpret fabrics. We applied that information to designs that communicated materiality and ambiguity in various ways, and studied how interfaces affected a user's process of exploring materials and negotiating the meaning of materiality.   The most important findings are user interface guidelines that apply to designing technology any domain focused on description and ambiguity, such as design domains. Such design guidelines include(1) the importance to communicate distinctions between description and category, (2) The role of ambiguity in design, while well-supported in the literature, is a value not shared among all practitioners, and (3) a better understanding of the different ways users negotiate with description and make sense of material remotely.\",","9923":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9924":"\"description-provenance\": [","9925":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-07T08:00:31Z (GMT).

Acquiring useful information from vegetation echoes facilitates the bats significantly in the navigation and foraging behaviors. To better understand the foliage echoes, in this dissertation, a computer model was constructed to simulate foliage echoes with following simplificationsapproximating leaves as circular disks, leaving out shading effects between leaves, and distributing leaves uniformly in the space. Then one tree can be described with three parameters in the model, leaf radius, orientation, and leaf density, where the first two determine the beampattern of each leaf. Compared with echoes collected from real trees, the simulation echoes are qualitatively accurate, i.e., they match in waveforms and also first-order statistics. Since the ground truth is known in the model, the three parameters were estimated with lasso model by selecting 40 features from each echo. The results have shown that estimation of one parameter with the other two known is usually successful with coefficient of determination close to one, and the classification still has reasonable accuracy when the number of known parameter is reduced to one. Besides, the three simplifications were examined with both experimental and simulation approaches. To assess the acoustic impact of leaf geometry on individual leaves, experiments were carried out by ensonifying leaves from both a single and different species. How the leaves' impulse responses change according to their equivalent radii was investigated. The simulation model of disks fits the experiments done with real leaves within one species and across species reasonably well. Shading effect is found to exist locally when two disks were 25 cm apart and were both in pulse direction. In addition, the inhomogeneous distribution of leaves was introduced by using the branching patterns of L-system. The evaluation of inhomogeneity in echoes produced with two distributions shows that there is always inhomogeneity in echoes, and L-system model does bring more inhomogeneity but not to the same extent as changes in the relative orientation between sonar beam and foliage do.\",","9971":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","9972":"\"description-provenance\": [","9973":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-08T08:00:15Z (GMT).

However, many commonly-used techniques in information visualization are not C^1 smooth, i.e. when represented as a function, they are either discontinuous or have a discontinuous first derivative.  For example, histograms are a non-smooth visualization of density.  Not only are histograms non-smooth visually, but they are also non-smooth over their parameter space, as they change abruptly in response to smooth change of bin width or bin offset.  For large data visualization, histograms are commonly used in place of smooth alternatives, such as kernel density plots, because histograms can be constructed from data cubes, allowing histograms to be constructed quickly for large datasets.  Another example of a non-smooth technique in information visualization is the commonly-used transition approach to animation.  Although transitions are designed to create smooth animations, the transition technique produces animations that have velocity discontinuities if the target is changed before the transition has finished.  The smooth and efficient zooming and panning technique also shares this problem---the animations produced are smooth while in-flight, but they have velocity discontinuities at the beginning and end and of the animation as well as velocity discontinuities when interrupted.  This dissertation applies ideas from signal processing to construct smooth alternatives to these non-smooth techniques.  To visualize density for large datasets, we propose BLOCs, a smooth alternative to data cubes that allows kernel density plots to be constructed quickly for large datasets after an initial preprocessing step.  To create animations that are smooth even when interrupted, we present LTI animation, a technique that uses LTI filters to create animations that are smooth, even when interrupted.  To create zooming and panning animations that are smooth, even when interrupted, we generalize signal processing systems to Riemannian manifolds, resulting in smooth, efficient, and interruptible animations.\",","10015":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10016":"\"description-provenance\": [","10017":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-09T08:00:35Z (GMT).

The first paper examines the separate effects of time and location of the School Breakfast Program on participation and consumption of breakfast by elementary school children in northern Nevada. Controlling for potential selection bias and unobserved individual fixed effects with a panel version of the Heckman sample selection model, it is shown that extra time allowed for breakfast leads to an approximately 20% increase in average participation, and the transition from cafeteria to classroom adds another 40% for the typical student. The second paper uses the Hedonic Property Valuation Method to quantify the willingness-to-pay of residents in the Dan River region for three dimensions of an improved food environment---availability, accessibility, and acceptability of food. This paper accounts for potential omitted variables issue in the hedonic analysis by applying a spatial-lag model, and finds an overall negative or null preference of residents in this region for an improved food environment. The third paper investigates the effects of characteristics of human interpreters and images on the accuracy of cloud interpretation for satellite images in an online experiment, using a fractional logit model. The results indicate that an image with higher cloud coverage and/or larger brightness is more likely to receive higher accuracy, and the more time spent on the image and more image completed are also beneficial for improving the accuracy. This paper also uses a logistic regression model to compare the performance of human interpreters to that of an automated algorithm, and finds that human interpreters outperform the automated algorithm for an average satellite image out of our twelve selected images.\",","10060":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10061":"\"description-provenance\": [","10062":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-12T08:00:29Z (GMT).

The spur gear pairs are analyzed using a finite element/contact mechanics (FE/CM) model. A hybrid analytical-computational (HAC) model is proposed for nonlinear gear dynamics. The HAC predictions are compared with FE/CM results and available experimental data for validation.  Chapter ref{{CH:GP_Strain}} investigates the static and dynamic tooth root strains in spur gear pairs using a finite element/contact mechanics approach.  Extensive comparisons with experiments, including those from the literature and new ones, confirm that the finite element/contact mechanics formulation accurately predicts the tooth root strains.  The model is then used to investigate the features of the tooth root strain curves as the gears rotate kinematically and the tooth contact conditions change.  Tooth profile modifications are shown to strongly affect the shape of the strain curve. The effects of strain gage location on the shape of the static strain curves are investigated.  At non-resonant speeds the dynamic tooth root strain curves have similar shapes as the static strain curves. At resonant speeds, however, the dynamic tooth root strain curves are drastically different because large amplitude vibration causes tooth contact loss. There are three types of contact loss nonlinearities incomplete tooth contact, total contact loss, and tooth skipping, and each of these has a unique strain curve. Results show that different operating speeds with the same dynamic transmission error can have much different dynamic tooth strain.  Chapters ref{{CH:HAC_2DSingle}}, ref{{CH:HAC_2DMultiple}}, and ref{{CH:HAC_3DSingle}} develops a hybrid-analytical-computational (HAC) method for nonlinear dynamic response in gear systems. Chapter ref{{CH:HAC_2DSingle}} describes the basic assumptions and procedures of the method, and implemented the method on two-dimensional vibrations in spur gear pairs. Chapters ref{{CH:HAC_2DMultiple}} and ref{{CH:HAC_3DSingle}} extends the method to two-dimensional multi-mesh systems and three-dimensional single-mesh systems.   Chapter ref{{CH:HAC_2DSingle}} develops a hybrid analytical-computational (HAC) model for nonlinear dynamic response in spur gear pairs. The HAC model is based on an underlying finite element code. The gear translational and rotational vibrations are calculated analytically using a lumped parameter model, while the crucial dynamic mesh force is calculated using a force-deflection function that is generated from a series of static finite element analyses before the dynamic calculations. Incomplete tooth contact and partial contact loss are captured by the static finite element analyses, and included in the force-deflection function. Elastic deformations of the gear teeth, including the tooth root strains and contact stresses, are calculated. Extensive comparisons with finite element calculations and available experiments validate the HAC model in predicting the dynamic response of spur gear pairs, including near resonant gear speeds when high amplitude vibrations are excited and contact loss occurs. The HAC model is five orders of magnitude faster than the underlying finite element code with almost no loss of accuracy.  Chapter ref{{CH:HAC_2DMultiple}} investigates the in-plane motions in multi-mesh systems, including the idler chain systems and planetary gear systems, using the HAC method that introduced in Chap. ref{{CH:HAC_2DSingle}}. The details of how to implement the HAC method into those systems are explained. The force-deflection function for each mesh is generated individually from a series of static finite element analyses before the dynamic calculations. These functions are used to calculated the dynamic mesh force in the analytical dynamic analyses. The good agreement between the FE/CM and HAC results for both the idler chain and planetary gear systems confirms the capability of the HAC model in predicting the in-plane dynamic response for multi-mesh systems. Conventional softening type contact loss nonlinearities are accurately predicted by HAC method for these multi-mesh systems.   Chapter ref{{CH:HAC_3DSingle}} investigates the three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic response in helical gear pairs. The gear translational and rotational vibrations in the three-dimensional space are calculated using an analytical model, while the force due to contact is calculated using the force-deflection. The force-deflection is generated individually from a series of static finite element analyses before the dynamic calculations. The effect of twist angle on the gear tooth contact condition and dynamic response are included. The elastic deformations of the gear teeth along the face-width direction are calculated, and validated by comparing with the FE/CM results.\",","10103":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10104":"\"description-provenance\": [","10105":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-12T08:00:38Z (GMT).

L. innocua was nebulized into a 154 L biosafety chamber (~5 log CFU in 1 mL) at two relative humidity (RH) levels (83% and 65%).  Oxford Listeria agar plates, stainless steel coupons and polyethylene (HDPE) coupons in the chamber were exposed to the aerosolized bacteria for 5, 10, 20 or 40 minutes.  Also, at these times, air samples (100 L) were collected on to gelatin filters which were transferred to Oxford agar plates.  In the second part of the research, L. innocua was nebulized into an 11 m3 walk-in cooler where RH ranged from ~29-37%.  Aerosolized bacteria were collected on to Oxford agar plates for 10 min intervals and with 50 or 100 L air samples.        Recovery of L. innocua from steel, plastic and agar was significantly higher at 83% RH (2.7 cells/cm2) compared to 65% RH (0.45 cells/cm2).  Mean cell recovery from air samples (gelatin filters) was significantly higher (p<0.05) when collected 5 or 10 minutes after nebulization at 83% humidity (mean 2.2 CFU/L) compared to collection after 20 or 40 minutes or compared to all times under 65% humidity (mean 0.4 CFU/L).  Recovery from HDPE coupons (1.21 CFU/cm2) was 2.5 X recovery from Oxford agar (0.49 CFU/cm2).  In the walk-in cooler, total estimated mean recovery from Oxford media at 10 min after nebulizing was 0.48%, but only 0.04% for samples collected after 60 minutes.  The recovery of L. innocua from air samples after 60 min was one-fourth of the number recovered 5 min after nebulizing.  No significant difference in recovery was found between plates at different distances (2 \ufffd\\" 2.5 m) from the nebulizer in the walk-in cooler.  Understanding the survival of aerosolized Listeria and how it can colonize over time on a food contact surface will enhance our efforts to prevent transmission on a small and large scale.  The food industry will be able to implement better safety measures to prevent contamination by Listeria species.\",","10148":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10149":"\"description-provenance\": [","10150":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-16T08:00:20Z (GMT).

Many factors affect the nutritional composition of corn for silage, such as cropping system, including cover crops, and the composition of the corn plant cell wall. The objectives of the first study were to determine the nutritional quality of different winter crops for silage and to determine the impact of the various winter crops on the succeeding productivity of corn and sorghum. Experimental plots were planted with 15 different winter crop treatments5 winter annual grasses in monoculture or with one of two winter annual legumes (crimson clover [CC] and hairy vetch [HV]). After harvesting the winter crops, each plot was planted with either corn or forage sorghum. Crimson clover increased DM yield compared to monocultures but HV did not. Adding legumes increased the crude protein concentration, but reduced the fiber and sugar concentrations of the forages. Even though in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility was reduced with the addition of legumes, the concentration of highly digestible non-fibrous components is greater in the mixtures than the monocultures, increasing the nutritive value of the silage. The objective of the second study was to determine the cell wall (CW) composition along the corn stalk. Three phytomers of corn plants were examinedcenter (C) of ear insertion, upper (U) and lower (L) phytomers. Each phytomer was cut into 4 sectionstop (T), middle (M), bottom (B), and node (N). The CW, uronic acid (UA), glucose (GLU), and lignin concentrations did not change among phytomers. The concentrations of arabinose (ARA) and xylose (XYL) were greater in the U than in the L phytomers. Concentrations of CW, ARA, and XYL increased from B to T within the phytomer, but UA and GLU concentrations decreased from B to T. Lignin did not change within the phytomer.

The use of the large-aspect-ratio and the light-weight composite wing can lead to an enhanced flexibility of the aircraft wing, which may cause many aeroelastic problems such as large deflections, increased drag, onset of flutter, loss of control authority, etc. Aeroelastic tailoring, internal structural layout design and aerodynamic wing shape morphing are all considered to address these aeroelastic problems through multidisciplinary design, analysis and optimization (MDAO) studies in this work.  Performance Adaptive Aeroelastic Wing (PAAW) program was initiated by NASA to leverage the flexibility associated with the use of the large-aspect-ratio wings and light-weight composite structures in a beneficial way for civil transport aircraft wing design. The biologically inspired SpaRibs concept is used for aircraft wing box internal structural layout design to achieve the optimal stiffness distribution to improve the aircraft performance. Along with the use of the active aeroelastic wing concept through morphing wing shape including the wing jig-shape, the control surface rotations and the aeroelastic tailoring scheme using composite laminates with ply-drop for wing skin design, a MDAO framework, which has the capabilities in total structural weight minimization, total drag minimization during cruise, ground roll distance minimization in takeoff and load alleviation in various maneuver loads by morphing its shape, is developed for designing models used in the PAAW program. A bilevel programming (BLP) multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) architecture is developed for the MDAO framework. The upper-level optimization problem entails minimization of weight, drag and ground roll distance, all subjected to both static constraints and the global dynamic requirements including flutter mode and free vibration modes due to the specified control law design for body freedom flutter suppression and static margin constraint. The lower-level optimization is conducted to minimize the total drag by morphing wing shape, to minimize wing root bending moment by scheduling flap rotations (a surrogate for weight reduction), and to minimize the takeoff ground roll distance. Particle swarm optimization and gradient-based optimization are used, respectively, in the upper-level and the lower-level optimization problems. Optimization results show that the wing box with SpaRibs can further improve the aircraft performances, especially in a large weight saving, as compared to the wing with traditional spars and ribs. Additionally, the nonuniform chord control surface associated with the wing with SpaRibs achieve further reductions in structural weight, total drag and takeoff ground roll distance for an improved aircraft performance. For a further improvement of the global wing skin panel design, an efficient finite element approach is developed in designing stiffened composite panels with arbitrarily shaped stiffeners for buckling and vibration analyses. The developed approach allows the finite element nodes for the stiffeners and panels not to coincide at the panel-stiffeners interfaces. The stiffness, mass and geometric stiffness matrices for the stiffeners can be transformed to those for the panel through the displacement compatibility at their interfaces. The method improves the feasible model used in shape optimizing by avoiding repeated meshing for stiffened plate. Also, it reduces the order of the finite element model, a fine mesh typically associated with the skin panel stiffened by many stiffeners, for an efficient structural analysis. Several benchmark cases have been studied to verify the accuracy of the developed approach for stiffened composite panel structural analyses. Several parametric studies are conducted to show the influence of stiffener shape/placement/depth-ratio on panel's buckling and vibration responses. The developed approach shows a potential benefit of using gradient-based optimization for stiffener shape design.\",","10237":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10238":"\"description-provenance\": [","10239":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-20T08:00:31Z (GMT).

Follow up studies using VP1 proteins from divergent strains and a mutant containing only the N-terminal domain of VP1 provided more insight into polymerase localization determinants.

This thesis presents scanning probe microscopy (SPM) investigation of emerging 2D materials, molecular nanostructures on 2D substrates at the nanometer scale, and biophysical processes on the biological membrane. Two main techniques of nano-probing are usedscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The study particularly emphasizes on self-assembled molecules on flat 2D materials and quasi-1D wrinkles.        First, we report the preparation of novel 1D C60 nanostructures on rippled graphene. Through careful control of the subtle balance between the linear periodic potential of rippled graphene and the C60 surface mobility, we demonstrate that C60 molecules can be arranged into a 1D C60 chain structure of two to three molecules in width. At a higher annealing temperature, the 1D chain structure transitions to a more closely packed, quasi-1D hexagonal stripe structure. The experimental realization of 1D C60 structures on graphene is, to our knowledge, the first in the field. It could pave the way for fabricating new C60/graphene hybrid structures for future applications in electronics, spintronic and quantum information. Second, we report a study on nano-morphology of potential operative donors (e.g., C60) and acceptors (e.g., perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, aka. PTCDA) on wrinkled graphene supported by copper foils. We realize sub-monolayer C60 and PTCDA on quasi-1D and quasi-2D real periodic wrinkled graphene, by carefully controlling the deposition parameters of both molecules. Our successful realization of acceptor-donor binary nanostructures on wrinkled graphene could have important implications in future development of organic solar cells.        Third, we report an STM and spectroscopy study on atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) material. TMDCs are emerging 2D materials recently due to their intriguing physical properties and potential applications. In particular, our study focuses on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) mono- to few-layers and pyramid nanostructures synthesized through chemical vapor deposition. On the few-layered MoS2 nanoplatelets grown on gallium nitride (GaN) and pyramid nanostructures on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), we observe an intriguing curved region near the edge terminals. The measured band gap in these curved regions is consistent with the direct band gap in MoS2 monolayers. The curved features near the edge terminals and the associated electronic properties may contribute to understanding catalytic behaviors of MoS2 nanostructures and have potential applications in future electronic devices and catalysts based on MoS2 nanostructures.       Finally, we report a liquid-cell AFM study on the endosomal protein sorting process on the biological lipid membrane. The sorting mechanism relies on complex forming between Tom1 and the cargo sorting protein, Toll interacting protein (Tollip). The induced conformational change in Tollip triggers its dissociation from the lipid membrane and commitment to cargo trafficking. This collaborative study aims at characterizing the dynamic interaction between Tollip and the lipid membrane. To study this process we develop the liquid mode of AFM. We successfully demonstrate that Tollip is localized to the lipid membrane via association with PtdIns3P (PI(3)P), a major phospholipid in the cell membrane involved in protein trafficking.\",","10328":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10329":"\"description-provenance\": [","10330":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-21T08:00:34Z (GMT).

This investigation focuses on the formulation (\u03b7n-arene)M(L)X, (L = ethylenediamine or \u03b1-amino carboxylate), (M= Ir, Rh, Ru, Co). Arene, Ligand and metal center variations were designed to tailor antimicrobial activity specific for each organism studied (Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacteria). Each of the D/L-amino acids formed a diasteromeric complex with chiral centers on both the metal center and amino acid ligand.  The unique chirality of each center elicits different antimicrobial activity against the Mycobacteria studied. The metal center (M), arene ligand (\u03b7n-arene), and amino acid (aa), were changed independently and studied for the antimicrobial activity.  In a similar fashion, each of the complexes modified with ethylenediamine and diamine derivatives were studied for their antimicrobial activity against S.aureus. All complexes were synthesized,characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and elemental analysis.  During the course of this work it was found that the amino acid complexes with all metal centers were specific for antimicrobial activity against all types of Mycobacteria, while the diamine derivatives were active against different strains of S.aureus. Acitvity was measured  to be as low as 2 ug/mL respectively depending on the complex used. A structure activity relationship was developed to determine what combinations of ligand, metal and arene were necessary to achieve the highest antimicrobial activity.  The optimal arene R-chain length for CpR was determined to be R=hexyl for all complexes studied.  The most active amino acidcomplex was determined to be that of L-phenylglycine for Mycobacteria, the cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexane complex is the most active ligand against S.aureus. Each metal center had similar activity levels. Toxicological studies were performed to test their viablity to be used in mammalian systems.  The complexes with the highest activity were studied against several mammailan cell lines and revealed that mammailan cells were undergoing normal cellular processes at up to 40 times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). A study of the MOA or mechanism of action revealed the ability of the amino acid complexes to affect the peptidyl transferase region on the 23s ribosomal subunit of M.smegmatis. This was accomplished by isolating resistant strains of M.smegmatis towards the most effective complex (Cp*hexyl)Ir(L-phenylglycine)-Cl.

Salt pollution can cause adverse effects to aquatic biodiversity, ecosystem function, ecosystem services, and human health. In many regions of the world, and in coal-mining-influenced streams of the temperate forests of Appalachia USA, specific conductance (SC), a surrogate measure for the dissolved major ions composing salinity, has been linked to decreased diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates. However, assessments used to reach this conclusion have generally not accounted for temporal variability of salinity, as most studies use \\"snapshot\\" SC data collected concurrently with biological data at a single point in time. Effective management of salinization requires tools to accurately monitor and predict salinity while accounting for temporal variability. To improve those tools, I conducted analyses of 4.5 years of salinity and benthic macroinvertebrate data from 25 forested headwater streams spanning a gradient of salinity where non-salinity stressors were minimized. My objectives were to1) model the annual pattern of salinity, 2) determine if salinity measures derived from continuous data are more precise than snapshot SC as predictors of aquatic biology, and 3) quantify response to salinity of the benthic macroinvertebrate community. A sinusoidal model of the annual cycle of SC using daily measurements for 4.5 years revealed that salinity naturally deviated \u00b1 20% from annual mean levels, with minimum SC occurring in late winter and maximum SC occurring in late summer. The pattern was responsive to seasonal dilution as driven by catchment evapotranspiration dynamics. Alternative discrete sampling intervals can approximate the pattern revealed by continuous SC data if sampling intervals are \u2264 30 days. Continuous SC variables did not significantly improve precision for prediction of benthic macroinvertebrate metrics (p > 0.1) as compared to snapshot SC using generalized additive mixed models. Results suggest that snapshot SC is a capable predictor of benthic macroinvertebrate community structure if sampling is carefully timed. However, continuous SC data can quantify chronic salt exposure, which supports a hypothesis to explain how temporal variability of field-based observations of salt sensitivity of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa may be influenced by life stage. Benthic macroinvertebrate community structure diverged from reference condition as salinity increased, with stronger relationships in Spring than in Fall. Intra-seasonal variation in community structure was also revealed across sampling dates. Non-Baetidae Ephemeroptera were most sensitive to salinity, with richness and abundance lower than reference at SC > 200 =\u00b5S/cm in Spring based on snapshot SC. Equivalent effects were predicted by mean monthly SC of 250-300 \u00b5S/cm from the prior Fall. Continuous conductivity monitoring may improve assessment of salinity effects because they can describe life-cycle exposure, which may aid investigations of mechanisms driving field-based observations of benthic-macroinvertebrate community alteration.\",","10420":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10421":"\"description-provenance\": [","10422":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-28T08:00:19Z (GMT).

However, the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the mammary gland is also of importance for its ability to regulate cell shape, proliferation, polarity, differentiation, gene transcription, protein synthesis, and secretion. Decorin is an ECM proteoglycan known to impact mammary cell proliferation in humans and rodents. Prior to this work, very little was known about decorin in bovine mammary biology. A series of bovine mammary cell culture experiments was conducted. The first experiment demonstrated existence of decorin pathway molecules in immortalized bovine mammary cells, but stopped short of demonstrating mature decorin proteoglycan deposition into the extracellular space. During the investigation it was noted that when cultured under basal conditions, intracellular decorin core protein (DCP) localization patterns appeared to be coordinated with specific phases of the cell cycle. Therefore, the objective of the second set of experiments was to characterize DCP localization patterns in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BME) at known phases of the cell cycle. The work was carried out in two sequential experiments. The hypothesis of the first experiment was that DCP accumulates in BME during S-phase of the cell cycle; the research rejected this hypothesis. The hypothesis of the second experiment, formulated after completion of the first experiment for this objective, was that DCP accumulates in BME during metaphase of the cell cycle. However, the experiment was unable to confirm of reject this hypothesis. Major findings were that both BME and mammary fibroblasts produce DCP and known decorin pathway molecules. BME produce intracellular DCP, but it is not accumulated during the S-phase of the cell cycle. However, it is still unknown if DCP is accumulated in BME during metaphase. Future research should focus on further characterization of decorin and its associated pathway molecules to learn if decorin induces proliferation or apoptosis of bovine mammary epithelial cells. This is important because number and activity of mammary epithelial cells ultimately determine milk yield in dairy cows. Fundamental knowledge gained in this research area may one day be applied at the animal-level and lead to gains in milk production efficiency by altering the cellular composition of mammary glands.\",","10465":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10466":"\"description-provenance\": [","10467":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-28T08:00:40Z (GMT).

It is marked by the appearance of enigmatic Ediacara-like fossils and macroalgae, which had existed since the early Proterozoic, but started to diversify morphologically and ecologically during this geological period. Nevertheless, paleontologists have been studying Ediacaran fossils for more than a century, the key questions about these fossils remain unanswered, including their phylogenetic affinities, taphonomic history, ecology, and paleoenvironmental distribution. Thus, new ways of investigation need to be employed to unveil enigmas of Ediacaran organisms. As well as, scientists need to engage other representatives of Ediacaran assemblages, such as macroalgae, to fully understand how those communities operated in the past.  The chapters of this original research in this dissertation demonstrate innovative approaches and methods for studying the paleoecology and taphonomy of Ediacaran macrofossils. The second chapter presents the results of a geochemical analysis to resolve taphonomic and paleoecological questions about the Ediacara-like discoidal holdfast fossil Aspidella. Stable isotope data of organic carbon, carbonate carbon/oxygen, and pyrite sulfur were integrated with iron speciation data to reconstruct the taphonomy, paleoecology, and paleoenvironments of Aspidella fossils. The third chapter presents results from a comprehensive analysis of macroalgae from Proterozoic to early Paleozoic. In this study, a database of macroalgal fossil was updated and analyzed in order to gain insights into the big-picture evolutionary patterns of macroalgal morphology and ecology through time. These methods and approaches offer new opportunities to test major paleobiologic and geobiologic hypotheses, thus improving our understanding of the history of the biosphere and the Earth system.\",","10508":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10509":"\"description-provenance\": [","10510":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-30T08:00:15Z (GMT).

This study focused on the development of a physical supply chain network and the optimization of a green supply chain network for cellulosic bio-butanol. To develop the physical supply chain network, the production process, material flow, physical supply chain participants, and supply chain logistics activities of cellulosic bio-butanol were identified by conducting an onsite visit and survey of current bio-fuel stakeholders. To optimize the green supply chain network for cellulosic bio-butanol, the life cycle analysis was integrated into a multi-objective linear programming model. With the objectives of maximizing the economic profits and minimizing the greenhouse gas emissions, the proposed model can optimize the location and size of a bio-butanol production plant. The mathematical model was applied to a case study in the state of Missouri, and solved the tradeoff between the feedstock and market availabilities of sorghum stem bio-butanol. The results of this research can be used to support the decision making process at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels of cellulosic bio-butanol commercialization and cellulosic bio-butanol supply chain optimization.

Rayleigh-B'enard convection is a paradigmatic example of spatiotemporal chaos that is also experimentally accessible. Discoveries uncovered using numerics can often be compared with experiments which can provide new physical insights. Lyapunov diagnostics can provide important information about the dynamics of small perturbations for chaotic systems. Covariant Lyapunov vectors reveal the true direction of perturbation growth and decay. The degree of hyperbolicity can also be quantified by the covariant Lyapunov vectors. To know whether a dynamical system is hyperbolic is important for the development of a theoretical understanding. In this thesis, the degree of hyperbolicity is calculated for chaotic Rayleigh-B'enard convection. For the values of the Rayleigh number explored, it is shown that the dynamics are non-hyperbolic. The spatial distribution of the covariant Lyapunov vectors is different for the different Lyapunov vectors. Localization is used to quantify this variation. The spatial localization of the covariant Lyapunov vectors has a decreasing trend as the order of the Lyapunov vector increases. The spatial localization of the covariant Lyapunov vectors are found to be related to the instantaneous Lyapunov exponents. The correlation is stronger as the order of the Lyapunov vector decreases. The covariant Lyapunov vectors are also computed using a spectral element approach. This allows an exploration of the covariant Lyapunov vectors in larger domains and for experimental conditions. The finite conductivity and finite thickness of the lateral boundaries of an experimental convection domain is also studied. Results are presented for the variation of the Nusselt number and fractal dimension for different boundary conditions. The fractal dimension changes dramatically with the variation of the finite conductivity.\",","10597":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10598":"\"description-provenance\": [","10599":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-05T08:00:18Z (GMT).

Humans have the remarkable ability to interpret images and text from different perspectives in multiple modalities, and to use large amounts of commonsense knowledge while performing visual or textual tasks. Inspired by that ability, we approach commonsense learning as leveraging perspectives from multiple modalities for images and text in the context of vision and language tasks.  Given a target task (e.g., textual reasoning, matching images with captions), our system first represents input images and text in multiple modalities (e.g., vision, text, abstract scenes and facts). Those modalities provide different perspectives to interpret the input images and text. And then based on those perspectives, the system performs reasoning to make a joint prediction for the target task. Surprisingly, we show that interpreting textual assertions and scene descriptions in the modality of abstract scenes improves performance on various textual reasoning tasks, and interpreting images in the modality of Visual Question Answering improves performance on caption retrieval, which is a visual reasoning task. With grounding, imagination and question-answering approaches to interpret images and text in different modalities, we show that learning commonsense knowledge from multiple modalities effectively improves the performance of downstream vision and language tasks, improves interpretability of the model and is able to make more efficient use of training data.   Complementary to the model aspect, we also study the data aspect of commonsense learning in vision and language. We study active learning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) where a model iteratively grows its knowledge through querying informative questions about images for answers. Drawing analogies from human learning, we explore cramming (entropy), curiosity-driven (expected model change), and goal-driven (expected error reduction) active learning approaches, and propose a new goal-driven scoring function for deep VQA models under the Bayesian Neural Network framework. Once trained with a large initial training set, a deep VQA model is able to efficiently query informative question-image pairs for answers to improve itself through active learning, saving human effort on commonsense annotations.\",","10642":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10643":"\"description-provenance\": [","10644":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-06T08:00:18Z (GMT).

In the current work, the use of acoustics for non-intrusive flow monitoring in compressible flows is explored and a novel sonic anemometry and thermometry (SAT) technique is developed. Using multiple arrangements of SAT equipment, a compressible acoustic tomography technique was also developed to resolve flow non-uniformities. Three validation experiments were used to investigate the novel SAT technique performance, and a fourth validation experiment was used to explore compressible flow tomography capabilities.   In the first experiment, an unheated jet was used to verify that the acoustic technique could measure fluid velocities in high subsonic Mach number flows. The application demonstrated velocity root mean square (RMS) errors of 9 m/s in unheated jet flows up to Mach 0.83. Next, a heated jet facility was used to assess the impact of fluid temperature on measurement accuracy. Using jet Mach numbers up to 0.7 and total temperatures up to 700 K, RMS velocity and static temperature errors up to 8.5 m/s (2.4% of maximum jet velocity) and 23.3 K (3.3% of total temperature) were observed. Finally, the acoustic technique was implemented at the exhaust of a JT15D-1A turbofan engine to investigate technique sensitivity to bypass engine conditions. A mass flow rate and thrust estimation approach was developed and RMS errors of 1.1 kg/s and 200 N were observed in conditions up to an exhaust Mach number of 0.48. Since modern acoustic tomography techniques require an incompressible flow assumption for velocity detection, advancements were made to extend acoustic tomography methods to compressible flow scenarios for the final experiment. The approach was tested in the heated jet operating at Mach 0.48 and 0.72 (total temperature of 675 K, approximately 2.25 times the ambient) and numerical simulations were used to identify technique sensitivity to input variables and system design. This research marks the first time an acoustic method has been used to estimate compressible flow velocities and temperatures.\",","10691":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10692":"\"description-provenance\": [","10693":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-11T08:00:17Z (GMT).

Rough surfaces of varying element height (1-mm, 3-mm), shape (hemispheres, cylinders) and spacing (5.5-mm, 10.4-mm, 16.5-mm) were investigated in order to ascertain how the turbulent pressure fluctuations change with changes in roughness geometry. Rough surfaces which contain two types of elements are investigated and relationships between the combination surface and the individual surfaces have been uncovered. Measurements of the wall pressure fluctuations were made using pinhole microphones and hotwire measurements were made to obtain the velocity and turbulence field.  Among the principal findings is the development of two scaling laws for the low frequency pressure fluctuations. Both of these are based on the idea that the defect between the edge velocity and some local boundary layer velocity sustains the pressure fluctuations in the outer regions of the flow. The first scaling uses the broadband convection velocity as the local velocity of the large scale pressure fluctuations. The second scaling uses the mean boundary layer velocity. Both these scalings appear more robust than the previously proposed scalings for the low frequency region and are able to scale the pressure spectra of all the data to within 3.5-dB.  In addition, it was proven that the high frequency shear friction velocity scaling of Meyers et al. (2015) is universal to rough surfaces of different element shape and density. Physical insights into the shear friction velocity, on which this scaling is based, have been revealed. This includes an empirical formula which estimates the element pressure drag coefficient from the roughness density and the Reynolds number.  The slopes in the mid-frequency region were found to vary with element density and microphone location such that a useful scaling could not be determined for this region. The possibility of an overlap region is explored and the expectation of a -1 slope is disproved. It is hypothesised that an evanescent decay of the mid-frequency pressure fluctuations occurs between their actual location and the wall where they are measured. A method for accounting for this decay is presented in order to scale the pressure fluctuations in this region.  Lastly, a piecewise interpolation function for the pressure spectrum of rough wall turbulent boundary layers was proposed. This analytical function is based on the low frequency scaling on mean velocity and the high frequency scaling of Meyers et al. (2015) The mid-frequency is estimated by a spline interpolation between these two regions.\",","10739":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10740":"\"description-provenance\": [","10741":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-13T08:00:23Z (GMT).

To address these challenges, this work developed several experimental platforms to study adaptive thermal management strategies. Parallel to the experimental effort, multi-disciplinary models integrating heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and electro-thermal dynamics have been developed and validated, including detailed CFD models and lumped parameter models. The major contributions are twofold. First, this work developed actively controlled strategies and experimentally demonstrated their effectiveness on a practical sized battery pack and dynamic thermal loads. The results show that these strategies effectively reduced both the parasitic energy consumption and the temperature non-uniformity while maintaining the maximum temperature rise in the pack. Second, this work established a new two dimensional lumped parameter thermal model to overcome the limitations of existing thermal models and extend their applicable range. This new model provides accurate surface and core temperatures simulations comparable to detailed CFD models with a fraction of the computational cost.\",","10784":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10785":"\"description-provenance\": [","10786":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-14T08:00:18Z (GMT).

The conceptual framework for this study was Baxter Magolda's (2008) dimensions of Self-AuthorshipEpistemological, Interpersonal, and Intrapersonal.  Data were collected through interviews with men in their final year of study in college.  The Masculine Behavior Scale (Snell, 1996) was utilized to organize participants into three groupshigh scorers, medium scorers, and low scorers, which allowed me to further examine their experiences within the dimensions of Self-Authorship.    Analysis of the data revealed three key findings.  First, participant scores on the Masculine Behavior Scale declined as their motivation to learn moved from external (status, power, etc.) to internal factors (learning for the sake of learning).  Second, high scorers formed relationships that affirmed their abilities. Yet, medium/low scorers developed relationships for the sake of mutual benefit.

However, these approaches are limited to provide the direct description of intracellular metabolism (e.g., metabolic fluxes) of microorganisms.  Therefore, in this study, I have applied computational modeling approaches (i.e., 13C assisted pathway and flux analysis, flux balance analysis, and machine learning) to both planktonic and biofilm cells for better understanding intracellular metabolisms and providing valuable biological insights. First, I have summarized recent advances in synergizing 13C assisted pathway and flux analysis and metabolic engineering. Second, I have applied 13C assisted pathway and flux analysis to investigate the intracellular metabolisms of planktonic and biofilm cells. Various biological insights have been elucidated, including the metabolic responses under mixed stresses in the planktonic states, the metabolic rewiring in homogenous and heterologous chemical biosynthesis, key pathways of biofilm cells for electricity generation, and mechanisms behind the electricity generation. Third, I have developed a novel platform (i.e., omFBA) to integrate multi-omics data with flux balance analysis for accurate prediction of biological insights (e.g., key flux ratios) of both planktonic and biofilm cells. Fourth, I have designed a computational tool (i.e., CRISTINES) for the advanced genome editing tool (i.e., CRISPR-dCas9 system) to facilitate the sequence designs of guide RNA for programmable control of metabolic fluxes. Lastly, I have also accomplished several outreaches in metabolic engineering. In summary, during my Ph.D. training, I have systematically applied computational modeling approaches to investigate the microbial metabolisms in both planktonic and biofilm states. The biological findings and computational tools can be utilized to guide the scientists and engineers to derive more productive microorganisms via metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. In the future, I will apply 13C assisted pathway analysis to investigate the metabolism of pathogenic biofilm cells for reducing their antibiotic resistance.\",","10872":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10873":"\"description-provenance\": [","10874":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-17T08:00:30Z (GMT).

However, fire hazards remain omnipresent in underground coal mines in the U.S. and around the world. A precise fire numerical analysis (simulation) before any fire events can give a broad view of the emergency scenarios, leading to improved emergency response, and better health and safety outcomes. However, the simulation cost of precise large complex dynamical systems such as fire in underground mines makes practical and even theoretical application challenging. This work details a novel methodology to reduce fire and airflow simulation costs in order to make simulation of complex systems around fire and mine ventilation systems viable. This study will examine the development of a Reduced Order Model (ROM) to predict the flow field of an underground mine geometry using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to reduce the airflow simulation cost in a nonlinear model. ROM proves to be an effective tool for approximating several possible solutions near a known solution, resulting in significant time savings over calculating full solutions and suitable for ensemble calculations. In addition, a novel iterative methodology was developed based on the physics of the fluid structure, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) of the dynamical system, and the vortex dynamics to determine the interface boundary in multiscale (3D-1D) fire simulations of underground space environments. The proposed methodology was demonstrated to be a useful technique for the determination of near and far fire fields, and could be applied across a broad range of flow simulations and mine geometries. Moreover, this research develops a methodology to analyze the tenable limits in a methane fire event in an underground coal mine for bare-faced miners, mine rescue teams, and fire brigade teams in order to improve safety and training of personnel trained to fight fires. The outcomes of this research are specific to mining although the methods outlined might have broader impacts on the other fields such as tunneling and underground spaces technology, HVAC, and fire protection engineering industries.\",","10923":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10924":"\"description-provenance\": [","10925":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-17T08:00:58Z (GMT).

Similarly, given the Twitter following network and tweets, how to choose the best communities/groups to stop rumors from spreading? How to find the best accounts that bridge celebrities and ordinary users? These questions are related to diffusion (aka propagation) phenomena. Diffusion can be treated as a behavior of spreading contagions (like viruses, ideas, memes, etc.) on some underlying network. It is omnipresent in areas such as social media, public health, and cyber security. Examples include diseases like flu spreading on person-to-person contact networks, memes disseminating by online adoption over online friendship networks, and malware propagating among computer networks. When a contagion spreads, network structure (like nodes/edges/groups, etc.) plays a major role in determining the outcome. For instance, a rumor, if propagated by celebrities, can go viral. Similarly, an epidemic can die out quickly, if vulnerable demographic groups are successfully targeted for vaccination.  Hence in this thesis, we aim to optimize and understand network structure better in light of diffusion. We optimize graph topologies by removing nodes/edges for controlling rumors/viruses from spreading, and gain a deeper understanding of a network in terms of diffusion by exploring how nodes group together for similar roles of dissemination. We develop several novel graph mining algorithms, with different levels of granularity (node/edge level to group/community level), from model-driven and data-driven perspectives, focusing on topics like immunization on networks, graph summarization, and community detection. In contrast to previous work, we are the first to systematically develops more realistic, implementable and data-based graph algorithms to control contagions. In addition, our thesis is also the first work to use diffusion to effectively summarize graphs and understand communities/groups of networks in a general way.  1. Model-driven. Diffusion processes are usually described using mathematical models, e.g., the Independent Cascade (IC) model in social media, and the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model in epidemiology. Given such models, we propose to optimize network structure for controlling propagation (the immunization problem) in several practical and implementable settings, taking into account the presence of infections, the uncertain nature of the data and group structure of the population. We develop efficient algorithms for different interventions, such as vaccination (node removal) and quarantining (edge removal). In addition, we study the graph coarsening problem for both static and temporal networks to obtain a better understanding of relations among nodes when a contagion is propagating. We seek to get a much smaller representation of a large network, while preserving its diffusive properties.  2. Data-driven. Model-driven approaches can provide ideal results if underlying diffusion models are given. However, in many situations, diffusion processes are very complicated, and it is challenging or even impossible to pick the most suited model to describe them. In addition, rapid technological development has provided an abundance of data such as tweets and electronic medical records. Hence, in the second part of the thesis, we explore data-driven approaches for diffusion in networks, which can directly work on propagation data by relaxing modeling assumptions of diffusion. To be specific, we first develop data-driven immunization strategies to stop rumors or allocate vaccines by optimizing network topologies, using large-scale national-level diagnostic patient data with billions of flu records. Second, we propose a novel community detection problem to discover \\"bridge\\" and \\"celebrity\\" communities from social media data, and design case studies to understand roles of nodes/communities using diffusion.  Our work has many applications in multiple areas such as epidemiology, sociology and computer science. For example, our work on efficient immunization algorithms, such as data-driven immunization, can help CDC better allocate vaccines to control flu epidemics in major cities. Similarly, in social media, our work on understanding network structure using diffusion can lead to better community discovery, such as finding media accounts that can boost tweet promotions in Twitter.\",","10972":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","10973":"\"description-provenance\": [","10974":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-17T08:01:15Z (GMT).

This research extended elicitation approaches traditional focus on user needs and context to include criteria describing obstacles users encounter. Military veterans were selected for this research effort as representative users for a use case in technology design that addresses the difficulties associated with community reintegration.   This work provides several contributions to the UCD field. First, different elicitation methods were compared by the depth and breadth of design space criteria elicited. Guidelines were generated for designer use of phenomenology in practice.  Obstacles were added as an important facet of design, with corresponding grammar rules for construction. Finally, an algorithm was applied as a method for generating personas.  Additionally, this dissertation contributes to the field of veteran research. Some example contributions include a set of design space criteria for designers to consider when designing for veterans, and two veteran personas grounded in data procured from the analysis.  This research effort was conducted in three phaseselicitation, first-cycle analysis, and second-cycle analysis. The elicitation process engaged 40 military veterans to complete an interview session and a design session. These sessions explored the lived experience of veterans as they reintegrate into communities, and gathered their ideas for technology to assist with veteran reintegration. The researchers who conducted first-cycle coding focused on categorizing the most important participant statements (meaning units) using a codebook. This analysis resulted in over 3,000 meaning units. Additionally, the meaning unit corpus was subjected to systematic second-cycle analyses, using standardized linguistic structures to generate design space criteria. In total, over 6,000 design space criteria were discovered, and these criteria were synthesized to create personas using a situated data mining (SDM) algorithm.  Results suggest that the interview session was crucial to elicit higher quantity and broader coverage of design space criteria. It is recommended that designers conduct and analyze interviews that focus on understanding the lived experience of users (not on their technology ideas) as part of a UCD approach.\",","11015":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11016":"\"description-provenance\": [","11017":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-18T08:00:21Z (GMT).

In fiscally dependent school districts, superintendents must develop and guide the school district budget through two different boards with different responsibilities and interestsa school board focusing on the educational vision of the school district and a local governing board focusing on overall community needs and tax rates.

This multi-case study utilized Stake's (2006) multi-case analysis methods to determine findings from four cases selected using a stratified, purposeful sampling of school districts in Virginia, a fiscally dependent state.  The analysis resulted in eleven findings 1) Superintendents guide school district budgets through the local government approval process.  2) The fiscally dependent method of school district funding in Virginia has a direct impact on the development of the school district budget.  3) The importance of education in a community influences the budget development process.  4) Personalities and relationships can be more important than budget processes and documents.  5) Limited local revenue has an impact on the budget development process.  6) An appointed school board increases the importance of the local governing board and influences the budget approval process.  7) The depth to which local government leaders look at the budget details influences the district budget development process.  8) Superintendents ensure frequent and ongoing dialogue with local government leaders.  9) Superintendents maintain good relationships with the local government leaders.  10) Superintendents have a good budget process and budget document. 11) Superintendents involve and engage the larger school community.

Due to the large noise in the data and the high complexity of diseases (such as cancer), it is a challenging task for researchers to extract biologically meaningful information that can help reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. The challenges call for more efforts in developing efficient and effective computational methods to analyze the data at different levels so as to understand the biological systems in different aspects. In this dissertation research, we have developed novel Bayesian approaches to infer alternative splicing mechanisms in biological systems using RNA sequencing data. Specifically, we focus on two research topics in this dissertationisoform identification and phenotype-specific transcript assembly. For isoform identification, we develop a computational approach, SparseIso, to jointly model the existence and abundance of isoforms in a Bayesian framework. A spike-and-slab prior is incorporated into the model to enforce the sparsity of expressed isoforms. A Gibbs sampler is developed to sample the existence and abundance of isoforms iteratively. For transcript assembly, we develop a Bayesian approach, IntAPT, to assemble phenotype-specific transcripts from multiple RNA sequencing profiles. A two-layer Bayesian framework is used to model the existence of phenotype-specific transcripts and the transcript abundance in individual samples. Based on the hierarchical Bayesian model, a Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed to estimate the joint posterior distribution for phenotype-specific transcript assembly. The performances of our proposed methods are evaluated with simulation data, compared with existing methods and benchmarked with real cell line data. We then apply our methods on breast cancer data to identify biologically meaningful splicing mechanisms associated with breast cancer. For the further work, we will extend our methods for de novo transcript assembly to identify novel isoforms in biological systems; we will incorporate isoform-specific networks into our methods to better understand splicing mechanisms in biological systems.\",","11110":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11111":"\"description-provenance\": [","11112":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-25T08:00:14Z (GMT).

First, an experimental and theoretical study of the interaction between elastic beams and granular media under compressive loading is performed. Buckling loads of beams with different dimensions and boundary conditions within granular media of different depths and grain sizes are measured, and theoretically approximated using the Ritz energy approach, based on the concept of beam on an elastic foundation. Several nondimensional parameters and a scaling law are derived to characterize different interaction regimes between the beams and granular support. The findings from this work is believed to be helpful for improved understanding of interactions between elastic beams and surrounding elastic foundation with applications to piles, oil pipelines, and robotic needle insertion into soft tissues. Second, the role of axial compliance on the friction of extensible strips is investigated. Significant changes were observed in the static and kinetic friction of strips, when the effective axial compliance was changed. The underlying causes of the changes in the frictional response are explained and quantitatively predicted using an extended shear lag model. We believe that this study provides insights into the effect of axial compliance on the frictional response of materials, paving the way for design and optimization of systems where the static and kinetic friction forces play an important role. Third, the effect of normal force and rate on the kinetic friction of two different elastomers, namely acrylic and silicone-based elastomers is evaluated. A custom-built pendulum test setup was used to perform the friction test in dynamic conditions. Two substantially different responses with respect to the change in normal force were observed and the role of different contributions to the frictional response of viscoelastic materials, i.e. bulk hysteresis friction, adhesion friction, and cohesion friction, are discussed. Different scenarios such as modifying the surface by using graphite powder, reducing test velocity, and also performing drop tests to characterize the surface hysteresis of the elastomers, were considered to further explore the origin of frictional responses of the elastomers. This study could improve insights gained from Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) data when obtaining and interpreting the effect of normal force on kinetic COF of elastomers with potential applications to   tires, shoes, etc. where friction plays an important role. Last, a generalized scaling law, based on the classical fracture mechanics approach, is developed to predict the bond strength of adhesive systems. The proposed scaling law, which depends on the rate of change of bond area with compliance, is in apparent discrepancy with the previously reported scaling relationship that depends on the ratio of area to compliance. This distinction can have a profound impact on the expected bond strength of systems, particularly when failure mechanism changes or the compliance of the load train is increased. Furthermore, the shear lag model is implemented to derive a closed-form relation for the system compliance and the conditions where the two models deviate from each other are discussed and demonstrated.  The results obtained from this approach could lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the bond strength and the geometry and mechanical properties of adhesive systems, with applications to different types of adhesive joints such as bio-inspired adhesive, biomedical adhesive tapes, and structural adhesive joints.\",","11158":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11159":"\"description-provenance\": [","11160":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-27T08:00:15Z (GMT).

The objectives of this dissertation are to understand the fundamental microbiology of BES, develop cost-effective cathode catalysts, optimize the process engineering and identify the application niches. It has been shown in Chapter 2 that electrochemically active bacteria can take advantage of shuttle-mediated EET and create optimal anode salinities for their dominance. A novel statistical model has been developed based on the taxonomic data to understand and predict functional dynamics and current production. In Chapter 3, 4 and 5, three cathode catalyst (i.e., N- and S- co-doped porous carbon nanosheets, N-doped bamboo-like CNTs and MoS2 coated on CNTs) have been synthesized and showed effective catalysis of oxygen reduction reaction or hydrogen evolution reaction in BES. Chapter 6, 7 and 8 have demonstrated how BES can be combined with forward osmosis to enhance desalination or achieve self-powered hydrogen production. Mathematical models have been developed to predict the performance of the integrated systems. In Chapter 9, BES have been used as a research platform to understand the fate and removal of antibiotic resistant genes under anaerobic conditions.

Turbulent flows and flames of interests to practice inherently have three-dimensional (3D) spatial structures, and therefore diagnostic techniques that can instantaneously resolve their 3D spatial features have long been desired and probably are needed to ultimately answer some of the open research questions. The goal of this dissertation thus is to investigate such diagnostics and demonstrate their capability and limitations in a range of turbulent flows/flames. To accomplish this goal, this dissertation developed and evaluated the following three diagnostic methodstomographic chemiluminescence (TC), volumetric laser induced fluorescence (VLIF), and super-resolution planar laser induced fluorescence (SR-PLIF).   First, 3D flame topography of well-controlled laboratory flames was measured with TC method and validated by a simultaneous 2D Mie scattering measurement. The results showed that the flame topography obtained from TC and the Mie scattering agreed qualitatively, but quantitative difference on the order of millimeter was observed between these two methods. Such difference was caused by the limitations of the TC method. The first limitation involves TC's reliance on chemiluminescence of nascent radicals (mainly CH*) in reacting flows, causing ambiguity in the definition of flame front and limiting its applications to certain types of reactive flow only. The second limitation involves TC's inability to study an isolated region of interest because the chemiluminescence is emitted everywhere in the flame.   Based on the above understanding of the TC technique, the second part of this dissertation studied a VLIF method to overcome the above limitations of the TC technique. Compared with the TC technique, the VLIF method can be used in either reacting or non-reacting flow and on any particular region of interest. In the VLIF technique, the fluorescence signal was generated by exciting a target species with a laser slab of certain thickness. The signal was recorded by cameras from different perspectives, and then a VLIF tomographic algorithm was applied to resolve the spatial distribution of the concentration of the target species. An innovative 3D VLIF algorithm was proposed and validated by well-designed experiment. This model enables analysis of VLIF performance in terms of signal level, size of the field of view in 3D, and accuracy. However, due to the limited number of views and the tomographic reconstruction itself, the spatial resolution of VLIF methods is limited.  Hence, the third part of this dissertation investigated a SR-PLIF method to provide a strategy to improve the spatial resolution in two spatial directions, and also to extend the measurement range of scanning 3D imaging strategies. The SR-PLIF method used planar images captured simultaneously from two (or more) orientations to reconstruct a final image with resolution enhanced or blurring removed. Both the development of SR algorithm, and the experimental demonstration of the SR-PLIF method were reported.\",","11303":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11304":"\"description-provenance\": [","11305":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T08:00:32Z (GMT).

This makes them ideally suited for a variety of missions, including disaster response and relief, emergency scenarios, or exoskeleton systems for individuals with disabilities. This, however, requires significant advances in humanoid locomotion and control, as they are still slow, unnatural, inefficient, and relatively unstable. The work of this dissertation the state of the art with the aim was of increasing the robustness and efficiency of these bipedal walking platforms. We present a series of control improvements to enable reliable, robust, natural bipedal locomotion that was validated on a variety of bipedal robots using both hardware and simulation experiments.  A huge part of reliable walking involves maximizing the robot's control authority. We first present the development of a model predictive controller to both control the ground reaction forces and perform step adjustment for walking stabilization using a mixed-integer quadratic program. This represents the first model predictive controller to include step rotation in the optimization and leverage the capabilities of the time-varying divergent component of motion for navigating rough terrain. We also analyze the potential capabilities of model predictive controllers for the control of bipedal walking.  As an alternative to standard trajectory optimization-based model predictive controls, we present several optimization-based control schemes that leverage more traditional bipedal walking control approaches by embedding a proportional feedback controller into a quadratic program. This controller is capable of combining multiple feedback mechanismsground reaction feedback (the \\"ankle strategy\\"), angular momentum (the \\"hip strategy\\"), swing foot speed up, and step adjustment. This allows the robot to effectively shift its weight, pitch its torso, and adjust its feet to retain balance, while considering environmental constraints, when available.  To enable the robot to walk with straightened legs, we present a strategy that insures that the dynamic plans are kinematically and dynamically feasible to execute using straight legs. The effects of timing on dynamic plans are typically ignored, resulting in them potentially requiring significantly bending the legs during execution. This algorithm modifies the step timings to insure the plan can be executed without bending the legs beyond certain angle, while leaving the desired footsteps unmodified. To then achieve walking with straight legs we then presented a novel approach for indirectly controlling the center of mass height through the leg angles. This avoids complicated height planning techniques that are both computationally expensive and often not general enough to consider variable terrain by effectively biasing the solution of the whole-body controller towards using straighter legs. To incorporate the toe-off motion that is essential to both natural and straight leg walking, we also present a strategy for toe-off control that allows it to be an emergent behavior of the whole-body controller.  The proposed approach was demonstrated through a series of simulation and experimental results on a variety of platforms. Model predictive control for step adjustment and rough terrain is illustrated in simulation, while the other step adjustment strategies and straight leg walking approaches are presented recovering from external disturbances and walking over a variety of terrains in hardware experiments. We discuss many of the practical considerations and limitations required when porting simulation-based controller development to hardware platforms. Using the presented approaches, we also demonstrated a important conceptusing whole-body control frameworks, not every desired motion need be directly commanded. Many of these motions, such as toe-off, may simply be emergent behaviors that result by attempting to satisfy other objectives, such as desired reaction forces. We also showed that optimization is a very powerful tool for walking control, able to determine both stabilizing inputs and joint torques.\",","11389":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11390":"\"description-provenance\": [","11391":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-03T08:01:04Z (GMT).

The ultimate pH of meat is widely valued as an indicator of fresh meat quality as it directly affects the quality characteristics of color, texture, and water holding capacity. Therefore, our research was conducted to identify the processes responsible for determining ultimate pH. Pigs harboring the AMPK\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20223R200Q mutation produce meat with extremely low ultimate pH (pH ~ 5.3) that is detrimental to quality. This phenomenon is often attributed to a greater glycogen content in muscle from the mutant pigs compared to wild-type pigs. However, our research indicated that greater glycolytic flux in muscle from these pigs causes a lower ultimate pH rather than greater tissue glycogen deposition. On the other hand, however, AMPK\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20223R200Q pigs contain more mitochondria and retain greater oxidative capacity. Hence, we hypothesized that mitochondria may contribute to the lower ultimate pH in muscle of these pigs. To test our hypothesis, isolated mitochondria were incorporated into an in vitro system the mimics postmortem glycolysis. Mitochondria enhanced glycolytic flux and pH decline in the in vitro system similar to that of AMPK\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20223R200Q pigs. After a series of experiments, we found that the causative agent for enhanced glycolytic flux is a soluble mitochondrial protein. In other experiments, mitochondrial F1-ATPase was found to be responsible for the majority of this effect, principally through promoting greater ATP hydrolysis at lower pH values, thereby allowing for greater flux through glycolysis. These data suggest that variations in ultimate pH may be more thoroughly explained and predicted by the abundance of mitochondria.   Broiler pectoralis major muscle, which is a highly glycolytic muscle, possesses high ultimate pH (pH ~ 5.9) compared to pork and beef. We postulated that rapid carcass chilling reduces the flux through glycolysis, thereby causing premature termination of postmortem metabolism. Yet, chilling was only partially responsible for the high ultimate pH of pectoralis major muscle. However, we showed that pectoralis major of broiler chicken exhibits lower phosphofructokinase-1 activity compared to porcine longissimus lumborum muscle, which limits the flux through glycolysis.\",","11483":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"Consumer demand for high quality meat has increased dramatically over the past two decades. In order to meet this demand, it is crucial to understand factors that control the development of fresh meat quality characteristics. Consumers purchase meat based on color, but repeat purchases are also influenced by meat freshness, texture, and juiciness. These quality attributes develop after the animal has been harvested during the conversion of muscle to meat through a series of biochemical reactions. This conversion results in muscle acidification (pH decline) caused by the degradation of stored muscle energy that acidifies muscle. Normally, the muscle pH drops from a neutral value in living muscle to an acid value (~5.6) in fresh meat. In some cases, however, excessive acidification occurs and this can dramatically impact fresh meat quality characteristics. Our research program focuses on the mechanisms responsible for this extended acidification. To that end, we use mutant pigs known as RN\u2013 that produce meat with extremely low ultimate pH known as \u201cacid meat\u201d. While most believe that the extended pH decline in muscle of these pigs is a function of elevated energy in the muscle prior to harvesting, we showed that theses pigs have different muscle prior to harvest and this difference cause increased acidification during the transformation of muscle to meat. To investigate this issue further, we also examined the contribution of mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell) to this process mainly because muscle from the RN\u2013 pigs containing around 50% more mitochondria compared to normal pigs. Curiously, we have shown mitochondria participate in this process. Because mitochondria require oxygen to function and harvesting animals disrupts oxygen delivery to the muscle, mitochondria were considered irrelevant to the development of meat quality characteristics. Our studies have definitively proved that mitochondria can contribute to meat quality and may be key in improving fresh meat quality.\",","11484":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11485":"\"description-provenance\": [","11486":"\"Authormatarneh@vt.edu\",","11487":"\"Provide open and immediate access to the ETD\",","11488":"\"I hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and submitted with my ETD a   \t\t\t\twritten permission statement from the ower(s) of each third part copyrighted matter to be included   \t\t\t\tin my thesis or dissertation, allowing distribution as specified above.  \t\t\t\t I certify that the version I submitted is the same as that approved by my advisory committee.\",","11489":"\"Submitted by Janice Austin (jamarti1@vt.edu) on 2017-11-09T17:15:18Z  No. of bitstreams4  Matarneh_SK_D_2017.pdf2478557 bytes, checksuma534ab0e43974032110ed59c4abf4fb0 (MD5)  Matarneh Lawri's meat science permission.pdf331571 bytes, checksum89da5c6144a762461cdf5d3e5a34c947 (MD5)  Matarneh Net lactate accumulation permission.pdf109312 bytes, checksum1a68b4362a4c8f0ab709ed1eaa203d9b (MD5)  Matarneh New Aspects of Meat Quality permission.pdf103405 bytes, checksum07ffb2eaa71408d69300e8e5698cedac (MD5)\",","11490":"\"Approved for entry into archive by Janice Austin (jamarti1@vt.edu) on 2017-11-09T18:38:47Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams4  Matarneh_SK_D_2017.pdf2478557 bytes, checksuma534ab0e43974032110ed59c4abf4fb0 (MD5)  Matarneh Lawri's meat science permission.pdf331571 bytes, checksum89da5c6144a762461cdf5d3e5a34c947 (MD5)  Matarneh Net lactate accumulation permission.pdf109312 bytes, checksum1a68b4362a4c8f0ab709ed1eaa203d9b (MD5)  Matarneh New Aspects of Meat Quality permission.pdf103405 bytes, checksum07ffb2eaa71408d69300e8e5698cedac (MD5)\",","11491":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-09T19:41:23Z (GMT).

Analyzing various structural properties of and dynamics on such networks reveal valuable insights about the behavior of such systems. In today's data-rich world, we are deluged by the massive amount of heterogeneous data from various sources, such as the web, infrastructure, and online social media. Analyzing this huge amount of data may take a prohibitively long time and even may not fit into the main memory of a single processing unit, thus motivating the necessity of efficient parallel algorithms in various high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. In this dissertation, we present distributed and shared memory parallel algorithms for some important network analytic problems.  First, we present distributed memory parallel algorithms for switching edges in a network. Edge switch is an operation on a network, where two edges are selected randomly, and one of their end vertices are swapped with each other. This operation is repeated either a given number of times or until a specified criterion is satisfied. It has diverse real-world applications such as in generating simple random networks with a given degree sequence and in modeling and studying various dynamic networks. One of the steps in our edge switch algorithm requires generating multinomial random variables in parallel. We also present the first non-trivial parallel algorithm for generating multinomial random variables.  Next, we present efficient algorithms for assortative edge switch in a labeled network. Assuming each vertex has a label, an assortative edge switch operation imposes an extra constraint, i.e., two edges are randomly selected and one of their end vertices are swapped with each other if the labels of the end vertices of the edges remain the same as before. It can be used to study the effect of the network structural properties on dynamics over a network. Although the problem of assortative edge switch seems to be similar to that of (regular) edge switch, the constraint on the vertex labels in assortative edge switch leads to a new difficulty, which needs to be addressed by an entirely new algorithmic approach. We first present a novel sequential algorithm for assortative edge switch; then we present an efficient distributed memory parallel algorithm based on our sequential algorithm.  Finally, we present efficient shared memory parallel algorithms for generating random networks with exact given degree sequence using a direct graph construction method, which involves computing a candidate list for creating an edge incident on a vertex using the Erdos-Gallai characterization and then randomly creating the edges from the candidates.\",","11534":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11535":"\"description-provenance\": [","11536":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-10T09:00:45Z (GMT).

Thermal ablation of tumors is a relatively established method for the destruction of many tumor types, despite inherent shortcomings including incomplete tumor treatment and non-specific treatment. Novel therapies are currently studied including nanoparticle-based therapies to overcome these limitations. One field of research is focused on utilizing non-lethal hyperthermia to enhance carried chemotherapeutic drugs. Additionally a novel field of non-thermal ablations termed Irreversible Electroporation has recently been developed to treat tumors by irreversibly destroying cell membrane function through short electrical pulses.  The goal of the present study is to research two novel potential treatments for cancer that do not require thermal destruction of tissue. Firstly, we developed and tested novel ways to load the antineoplastic agent Cisplatin into SWNHs to test the ability to thermally enhance carried drugs with non-lethal, mild hyperthermia. We attached the imaging agent Quantum Dots (QDs) to the particles to understand how hyperthermia affects cellular uptake, minimizing thermal enhancement. Results of this study highlight the need for better biomimetic in vitro models of the tumors to study how hyperthermia affects tissue level transport of nanoparticles.  In the second aim we utilized a perfusable 3D collagen in vitro model of the tumor microenvironment, previously developed by our group to study tumor angiogenesis, to study nanoparticle transport. We demonstrated the ability of this model to study key mass transport obstacles nanoparticles face in the tumor including extravasation from a leaky, pro-angiogenic vasculature, diffusion in the extracellular matrix, and cellular uptake in a 3D environment. This model was then utilized in the third aim to study how mild hyperthermia affects transport of SWNHs. Results from this aim were valuable in showing the utility of the 3D in vitro model to controllably test the effects of external stimuli on transport of particles and shows how mild hyperthermia can selectively allow increased permeability of SWNHs in the tumor, increasing selectivity of nanoparticle transport to the targeted tissue.  Lastly, we tested the non-thermal ablation, high-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE) in a 3D tumor platform and in an in vivo swine model to better understand the ability of H-FIRE to produce repeatable destruction of hepatocellular carcinoma, a disease state growing in incidence rate. We then used H-FIRE in an outpatient treatment for infiltrative skin tumors in equines, showcasing the ability to deliver high voltage, short duration pulses in a clinical setting without muscle contractions. Ultimately, the results of this study the engineering studies that must occur to optimize novel treatments utilizing non-lethal hyperthermia, or non-thermal death mechanism to treat cancer. The studies show the usefulness of more complex 3D in vitro models of tumors for early development of novel therapies and the utility of in vivo models to validate studies.\",","11582":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11583":"\"description-provenance\": [","11584":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-10T09:01:06Z (GMT).

While an abundance of literature protocols have been reported, the majority utilize harsh reaction conditions in combination with expensive reagents. This dissertation discloses the author\u2019s contributions to the development of efficient, cost-effective, and operationally simple transition metal-catalyzed borylation protocols with alkynes and diboron reagents.   An open-to-air copper(II)-catalyzed aqueous borylation protocol of alkynoates and a symmetrical diboron reagent is reported. Conjugate addition of the boryl-copper species to the electrophilic \u03b2-carbon provided \u03b2-boryl-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters in moderate to excellent yields. Exclusive (Z)-stereochemistry was confirmed by nOe experiments. The resulting vinyl boronate esters are useful cross-coupling partners.   The scope of the aqueous \u03b2-borylation protocol was extended to the unsymmetrical diboron reagent, pinB-Bdan. This alternative protecting group has emerged as an orthogonal protecting group and alters the reactivity of the boron moiety. Activation of the pinacol moiety to form the Lewis acid-base adduct allowed for the chemoselective transfer of the 1,8- diaminonapthalene moiety to the \u03b2-carbon.   An alternative novel synthesis of vinyl, allyl diboronate esters from propargylic alcohols has also been described. Formation of a leaving group in-situ with a palladium- and coppercatalyzed protocol can lead to several competing reaction pathways and the formation of multiple products. Fortunately, the resulting vinyl, allyl diboronate esters were stereoselectively synthesized in moderate GC yields despite significate decomposition during purification, as confirmed by stability studies. The terminal diboration of allenes was previously the only reported method for the synthesis of vinyl, allyl diboronate esters.\",","11625":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11626":"\"description-provenance\": [","11627":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-11T09:00:14Z (GMT).

The cooperation can be accomplished in either an internal (osmotic microbial fuel cells, OsMFC) or external (microbial electrolysis cell-forward osmosis system, MEC-FO) configuration. In OsMFC, higher current generation than regular microbial fuel cell (MFC) was observed, resulting from the lower resistance of FO membrane. The electricity generation in OsMFC could greatly inhibit the reverse salt flux. Besides, ammonium removal was successfully demonstrated in OsMFC, making OsMFCs a promising technology for \\"NEW recovery\\" (NEWnutrient, energy and water). For the external configuration of OsBES, an MEC-FO system was developed. The MEC produced an ammonium bicarbonate draw solute via recovering ammonia from synthetic organic solution, which was then applied in the FO for extracting water from the MEC anode effluent. The system has been advanced with treating landfill leachate. A mathematical model developed for ammonia removal/recovery in BES quantitatively confirmed that the NH4+ ions serve as effective proton shuttles across cation exchange membrane (CEM).\",","11670":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11671":"\"description-provenance\": [","11672":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-15T09:00:15Z (GMT).

Scholars and government officials call for identifying key local actors and developing a more collaborative emergency preparedness approaches prior to disaster situations. In practice, emergency officials seldom recognize post-disaster efforts of these local actors. Efforts to anticipate the potential decisions and actions of organizations that do not routinely deal with disasters necessitate a better understanding of how managers perceive their post-disaster related roles and what may account for such perceptions. Focusing on public libraries in the U.S., this study draws on information gathered through surveys and semi-structured interviews with library managers and directors operating in Hampton Roads, Virginia. To further investigate variations in willingness to engage in emergency response among local jurisdictions, the study explores context-related characteristics such as organizational arrangements and features of the policy environment in which library managers operate as well as factors related to individual managerial practices. The study finds that library officials' perceptions vary across libraries. Variations range from a more defensive approach to a more proactive approach. Efforts to account for the extent to which officials would be willing to engage in a more proactive approach should consider both the emergence of individual-managers' entrepreneurial spirit and their involvement in community-based disaster planning.\",","11715":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11716":"\"description-provenance\": [","11717":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-18T09:00:15Z (GMT).

The uniaxial and equibiaxial extensional flows are studied using combined asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations. An initial value problem with a prescribed elongational stress is solved in the limit of large relaxation time. This gives rise to multiple time scales. If the initial stress is less than a critical value, the initial elastic elongation is followed by settling to an unyielded state at the slow time scale. If the initial stress is larger than the critical value, then yielding ensues. The extensional flows produce delayed yielding and hysteresis, both associated with thixotropy in complex fluids.\",","11759":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11760":"\"description-provenance\": [","11761":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-18T09:00:23Z (GMT).

Further, observations and interviews revealed ideological conflicts of the organization's key stakeholders that resulted in clashes between key stakeholder values and the language of the nonprofit's mission (and other genres). Additionally, ideological consensus resulted in the addition of new organizational activities and genres, even though these activities are not in line with the language of the mission statement as written. Eventually, these activities become social facts, \\"ideas that the key stakeholders believe are in line with the mission when they are, in fact, in conflict with it.

Mechanical alloying and powder metallurgy methods were used to prepare the samples. Mixtures of elemental powders of iron and 1.4, 3, and 6.67 wt.%  pre-milled graphite were milled in a SPEX mill with tungsten milling media for up to 100h. The milled powders were then cold-compacted and pressure-less sintered between 900\u00b0C and 1200\u00b0C for 1h and 5h followed by furnace cooling. Milled powders and sintered samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, Mossbauer spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopes. Density and micro-hardness were measured. The milled powders and sintered samples were studied as follows  In the milled powders, the formation of Fe_3 C was observed through Mossbauer spectroscopy after 5h of milling and its presence increased with milling time and carbon concentration. The particle size of the milled powders decreased and tended to become more equi-axed after 100h of milling. Micro-hardness of the milled powders drastically increased with milling time as well as carbon concentration. A DSC endothermic peak around 600\u00b0C was detected in all milled powders, and its transformation temperature decreased with milling time. In the literature, no explanation was found. In this work, this peak was found to be due to the formation of Fe_3 C phase. A DSC exothermic peak around 300\u00b0C was observed in powders milled for 5h and longer; its transformation temperature decreased with milling time. This peak was due to the recrystallization and/or recovery \u03b1-Fe and growth of Fe_3 C .   In the sintered samples, almost 100% of pearlitic structure was observed in sintered samples prepared from powders milled for 0.5h. The amount of the pearlite decreased with milling time, contrary to what was found in the literature. The decrease in pearlite occurred at the same time as an increase in graphite-rich areas. With milling, carbon tended to form graphite instead of Fe_3 C. Longer milling time facilitated the nucleation of graphite during sintering. High mount of graphite-rich areas were observed in sintered samples prepared from powders milled for 40h and 100h. Nanoparticles of Fe_3 C were observed in a ferrite matrix and the graphite-rich areas in samples prepared from powders milled for 40h and 100h. Micro-hardness of the sintered samples decreased with milling time as Fe_3 C decreased. The green density of compacted milled powders decreased with milling time and the carbon concentration that affected the density of sintered samples.\",","11898":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11899":"\"description-provenance\": [","11900":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-23T09:00:15Z (GMT).

In response to the need for a STEM literate workforce equipped with 21st century skills there is a push for K-12 educational reform. STEM literacy is the ability to use content knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering and math in solving human problems in a collaborative manner (NRC, 2009, Wiggins and McTighe, 2005). Researchers have argued that the integrative STEM education (I-STEM ED) pedagogical approach (with its roots in technology education) promotes active learning through student discovery of using science and mathematics content and practices in novel situations, with active construction of understanding by doing (Cajas, 2001; Wells, 2010, 2016b)  \tCritical thinking and problem solving (CT and PS) skills, collectively identified as 21st century skills by P21 (2005a), involved in solving authentic design problems are not assessed in traditional science and mathematics standardized testing or in Tech-ED classrooms in K-12 grades. Assessments in traditional classrooms, focus on the extent of correctness of the end-result, and rarely, if ever, on the reasoning or procedures leading to the result (Docktor and Heller, 2009; Shavelson, Ruiz-Primo, Li and Ayala, 2003; Steif and Dantzler, 2005). Furthermore, the content knowledge tested is directly related to what has been recently taught in the classroom, and eliminates the need for solvers' demonstration of metacognitive processes involved in CT and PS that require recalling/selecting the discipline specific content knowledge. Within traditional Tech-ED classrooms, students are assessed using competencies defined in the Career and Technical Education curriculum framework which do not focus on solving authentic problems. Herein lies the gap between what is needed for the 21st century worker and what is currently the focus of secondary education.  \tThe purpose of this study was to measure the extent to which students immersed in an I-STEM ED program were successful in solving an authentic design-based problem presented to them outside the context of the classroom where the content was learned. In addition, five specific student abilities (SAs) that contribute to authentic problem-solving were identified and a rubric to assess these SAs was developed and validated. A design-no-make challenge (DNMC) was developed and administered to these students.   \tAnalysis of their responses showed that students immersed in an integrative STEM education program performed significantly better in designing a solution to the DNMC when compared with a hypothesized mean for students in a traditional classroom. Furthermore, the specific SAs associated with selecting and utilizing the relevant science and math content and practices, and communicating logical reasoning in their design of a solution were found to be strongly correlated to students' successful problem-solving.\",","11941":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11942":"\"description-provenance\": [","11943":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-23T09:00:22Z (GMT).

A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of a 4P1S battery array using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to identify key frequencies that may describe battery state of health at any state of charge. Using a large sample number of cells, the state of health frequency, fSoH, for these LiFePO4 26650 cells is found to be 158 Hz. Four experiments were performed to evaluate the lifetime in different configurationssingle-cell at 1C (2.6A), single-cell at 10C (26A), four cells in parallel at 10C (ideal match), and four cells in parallel (manufacturer match). The lifetime for each experiment set degraded substantially, with the final parallel series reaching end of life at 400 cycles, a 75.32% reduction in life compared to operating solo. Analysis of the fSoH data for these cells revealed a change in imaginary impedance at the critical frequency that corresponded to changes in the capacity and current data, supporting the development of a single-frequency diagnostic tool. An electrochemical model of the battery was generated, and it indicated the anode material was aging faster than the SEI layer, the opposite of normal cell degradation. A post-mortem analysis of cells from three configurations (baseline, single-cell, and parallel-cell) supported the modeling, as physical damage to the copper current collector in the anode was visible in the parallel-connected cell.\",","11982":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","11983":"\"description-provenance\": [","11984":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-30T09:00:17Z (GMT).

Rapidly increasing volumes of these open sources are proving to be extremely valuable resources in helping analyze, detect, and forecast outbreaks of infectious diseases, especially new diseases or diseases spreading to new regions. However, these sources are in general unstructured (noisy) and construction of surveillance tools ranging from real-time disease outbreak monitoring to construction of epidemiological line lists involves considerable human supervision. Intelligent modeling of such sources using text mining methods such as, topic models, deep learning and dependency parsing can lead to automated generation of the mentioned surveillance tools. Moreover, realtime global availability of these open sources from web-based bio-surveillance systems, such as HealthMap and WHO Disease Outbreak News (DONs) can aid in development of generic tools which will be applicable to a wide range of diseases (rare, endemic and emerging) across different regions of the world.  In this dissertation, we explore various methods of using internet news reports to develop generic surveillance tools which can supplement traditional surveillance systems and aid in early detection of outbreaks. We primarily investigate three major problems related to infectious disease surveillance as follows. (i) Can trends in online news reporting monitor and possibly estimate infectious disease outbreaks? We introduce approaches that use temporal topic models over HealthMap corpus for detecting rare and endemic disease topics as well as capturing temporal trends (seasonality, abrupt peaks) for each disease topic. The discovery of temporal topic trends is followed by time-series regression techniques to estimate future disease incidence. (ii) In the second problem, we seek to automate the creation of epidemiological line lists for emerging diseases from WHO DONs in a near real-time setting. For this purpose, we formulate Guided Epidemiological Line List (GELL), an approach that combines neural word embeddings with information extracted from dependency parse-trees at the sentence level to extract line list features. (iii) Finally, for the third problem, we aim to characterize diseases automatically from HealthMap corpus using a disease-specific word embedding model which were subsequently evaluated against human curated ones for accuracies.\",","12029":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12030":"\"description-provenance\": [","12031":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-30T09:00:26Z (GMT).

While the availability of novel drugs, techniques, and surgical intervention has improved the survival rate of individuals with diabetes, the prevalence of diabetes is still rising. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a result of chronic insulin resistance and loss of -cell mass and function, and it is is always associated with the impairment in energy metabolism, causing increased intracellular fat content in skeletal muscle (SkM), liver, fat, as well as pancreatic islets. As such, the search for novel agents that simultaneously promotes insulin sensitivity and \ud835\udf37-cell survival may provide a more effective strategy to prevent the onset and progression of this disease. Kaempferol is a flavonol that has been identified in many plants and used in traditional medicine. It has been shown to elicit various pharmacological activities in epidemiological and preclinical studies. However, to date, the studies regarding its effect on the pathogenesis of diabetes are very limited. In this dissertation, I explored the anti-diabetic potential of the dietary intake of kaempferol in diet-induced obese mice and insulin-deficient diabetic mice.   For the first animal study, kaempferol was supplemented in the diet to determine whether it can prevent insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in high fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice or STZ-induced obese diabetic mice. For the second animal study, kaempferol was administrated once daily via oral gavage to diet-induced obese and insulin-resistant mice or lean STZ-induced diabetic mice to evaluate its efficacy for treating diabetes and further determining the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that dietary intake of kaempferol for 5 months (mo) improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerances, which were associated with increased Glut4 and AMPK\u03b1 expression in muscle and adipose tissues in middle-aged mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet. In vitro, kaempferol increased lipolysis and restored chronic high fatty acid-impaired glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in SkM cells, which were associated with improved AMPK\u03b1 activity and Glut4 expression. In addition, dietary kaempferol treatment preserved functional pancreatic \ud835\udf37-cell mass and prevented hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Data from the second study show that oral administration of kaempferol significantly improved blood glucose control in obese mice, which was associated with reduced hepatic glucose production and improved whole body insulin sensitivity without altering body weight gain, food consumption, or the adiposity. In addition, kaempferol treatment increased Akt and hexokinase activity, but decreased pyruvate carboxylase and glucose-6 phosphatase activity in the liver homogenate without altering their protein expression. Consistently, kaempferol decreased pyruvate carboxylase activity and suppressed gluconeogenesis in HepG2 cells as well as primary hepatocytes isolated from the livers of obese mice. Kaempferol directly blunted the activity of purified pyruvate carboxylase. In the last study, we found that kaempferol stimulates basal glucose uptake in primary human SkM. In C2C12 mouse myotubes, kaempferol also increased insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis and preserved insulin dependent glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake in the presence of fatty acids. Kaempferol stimulated Akt phosphorylation in a similar time-dependent manner as insulin in human SkM cells. Consistent with this, kaempferol increased Akt and AMPK phosphorylation in isolated murine red SkM tissue. The effect of kaempferol on glucose uptake was blunted in the presence of chemical inhibitors of glucose transporter 4 (Glut4), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), and AMPK. The AMPK inhibitor also prevented kaempferol-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Further, kaempferol improved the stability of insulin receptor substrate-1. Taken together, these studies suggest that the kaempferol is a naturally occurring compound that may be of use in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, as well as by preserving functional \ud835\udf37-cell mass.\",","12076":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12077":"\"description-provenance\": [","12078":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-02T09:00:16Z (GMT).

A heightened focus on counselor wellness in supervision has emerged as an intervention to improve quality of care to clients and prevent counselor impairment.  Although researchers have examined the benefits of wellness interventions in supervision, we have little understanding of the supervisor's ability to model wellness to their supervisees. Nor have researchers shown how a supervisor's wellness influences supervisee wellness\u2014and if and how the strength of the supervision relationship changes this influence.  Thus, the purpose of this quantitative investigation was to (a) analyze the role of modeled wellness as a way for supervisors to influence the multifaceted aspects of supervisee wellness, and (b) identify if the factoring in the supervisory relationship changes this influence.  \tThis quantitative study included a sample of 105 counselor education students enrolled in practicum or internship courses who were receiving supervision from a site-based supervisor. Results indicated that supervisee personal wellness was influenced by the supervisee's perception of supervisor wellness.  Certain second-order factors of perceived supervisor wellness (Creative and Coping Selves) were more predictive of the corresponding factor of supervisee personal wellness.  When the strength of the supervisory relationship was considered, the model became more predictive despite the lack of correlation between the strength of the supervisory relationship and supervisee personal wellness.  Results from this investigation suggest that the supervisory relationship can act as a suppressor variable, controlling for error in the equation and making the perception of supervisor wellness a more valid predictor.  A subsequent correlational analysis suggests that the error in prediction was primarily in supervisory relationships of moderate strength.  The combination of the supervisee's perception of their supervisor's wellness and the strength of the supervisory relationship predicted 9% of the variance in supervisee wellness.  Implications for counselors, supervisors, educators, and policy are discussed.  Limitations and recommendations for future inquiry are highlighted based on the findings from this investigation.\",","12122":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12123":"\"description-provenance\": [","12124":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-05T09:00:18Z (GMT).

It was determined, through a literature review, that research focused on the school culture, leadership, teacher and parent factors concerning turnaround reform efforts, but there was little mention of students beyond the scores they produce on end-of-the-year standardized tests.  The central research question investigated the student-related factors that impact a school's ability to increase academic achievement within the turnaround process.  Interviews were conducted with four successful turnaround principals in Virginia. The results of the study indicated the student factors thought to impact learning were reading issues, teacher competency issues, students' personal needs, attendance issues, and discipline issues.   While the first inclination of school leaders in a failing school may be to find the 'quick fix' to turn scores around, the principals in this study focused on three fundamental goalsget the students to read more, keep students in the classroom, and meet students' needs.   Research in the area of turnaround strategies and implementation is useful for school boards and principals as they endeavor to raise the achievement of their students.  This study of successful turnaround organizations focusing on how student-related factors impact academic performance would be beneficial in determining whether the organizational structure supports or hinders Priority School reform.  This examination of how student-related factors contribute to an organization's capability to turn around low performance informs administrators and policy makers on strategies to overcome the learning barriers that may exist.\",","12210":"\"description-degree\": \"EDD\",","12211":"\"description-provenance\": [","12212":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-05T09:00:33Z (GMT).

They are also a space for identity work and rehearsal of alternative agrifood movement practice (AAMs; MacAuley and Niewolny, 2016; Pilgeram, 2011). AAMs embody and recursively construct values of biophysical sustainability, food quality, egalitarianism, and agrarianism (Constance, Renard, and Rivera-Ferre; 2014). However, AAMs have been critiqued for disproportionately representing upper- to middle-class white cultural norms (Allen, 2004; Guthman, 2008a; Slocum, 2007), for romanticized agrarian ideology (Carlisle, 2013), and for mechanisms reproductive of neoliberalism, which buttresses the dominant agrifood system (Guthman, 2008b). These AAM discourse elements are expressed in on-farm apprenticeships. On-farm apprenticeships are variably understood as beginning farmer training (Hamilton, 2011), as inexpensive farm labor (MacAuley and Niewolny, 2016; Pilgeram, 2011), and as sites of tension between economic and non-economic attributes (Ekers, Levkoe, Walker, and Dale, 2016). I illuminate these dynamics within on-farm apprenticeships through the complementary theoretical lenses of cultural historical activity theory (Engestr\u00f6m, 1999), cognitive praxis (Eyerman and Jamison, 1991), and cultural identity theory (Hall, 1996). I employ critical ethnographic case study methodology to explore issues of power, social reproduction, and equity. I conducted 53 days of participant observation, worked alongside 19 apprentices on six farms for 37 days, conducted interviews (n=25), and completed a document analysis (n=407). I observed white spaces and class-based work values re/produced, mediated by AAM discourse. Furthermore, I observed three distinct objectives within the activity systembeginning farmer training, inexpensive labor for farms, and an authentic farm lifestyle experience. In contrast to the first two, this third objective, the authentic lifestyle, resists market-based logics. Instead, logics that did govern behavior include membership in a movement; an ascetic bent; the valorization of farmers and the authentic farm lifestyle; alignment with clean, healthy, and dirty parts of the job; and communitarianism. These logics point towards the creation of a third type of nonmarket/quasimarket space (Gibson-Graham, Cameron, and Healy, 2013). I describe several considerations for on-farm apprenticeship to lead to greater equity, reproduction of viable small farm labor models, and stabilized and legitimate nonmarket understandings of what makes on-farm apprenticeship function.\",","12256":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12257":"\"description-provenance\": [","12258":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-05T09:00:40Z (GMT).

Specifically, two classes of nonlinear systems are studied in this dissertation. The first topic develops a novel framework for adaptive estimation of nonlinear systems using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. A nonlinear adaptive estimation problem is cast as a time-varying  estimation problem in $mathbb{R}^d times H$. In contrast to most conventional strategies for ODEs, the approach here embeds the estimate of the unknown nonlinear function appearing in the plant in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), $H$. Furthermore, the well-posedness of the framework in the new formulation is established. We derive the sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness, and stability of an infinite dimensional adaptive estimation problem. A condition for persistence of excitation in a RKHS in terms of an evaluation functional is introduced to establish the convergence of finite dimensional approximations of the unknown function in RKHS. Lastly, a numerical validation of this framework is presented, which could have potential applications in terrain mapping algorithms.  The second topic  delves into  estimation and control of history dependent differential equations. This study is motivated by the increasing interest in estimation and control techniques for  robotic systems whose governing equations include history dependent nonlinearities. The governing dynamics are modeled using a specific form of functional differential equations. The class of history dependent differential equations  in this work is constructed using integral operators that depend on distributed parameters. Consequently, the resulting estimation and control equations define a distributed parameter system whose state, and distributed parameters evolve in finite and infinite dimensional spaces, respectively. The well-posedness of the governing equations is established by deriving sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness and stability for the class of functional differential equations. The error estimates for multiwavelet approximation of such history dependent operators are derived. These estimates help determine the  rate of convergence of finite dimensional approximations of the online estimation equations to the infinite dimensional solution of distributed parameter system. At last, we present the adaptive sliding mode control strategy developed for the history dependent functional differential equations and numerically validate the results on a simplified pitch-plunge wing model.\",","12302":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12303":"\"description-provenance\": [","12304":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-06T09:00:17Z (GMT).

College costs are high and they continue to rise while the median family income shows only modest increases. By lowering the cost of attendance, financial aid makes it possible for many students, especially those from low and middle-income families to attend college. FAFSA is the main instrument used in distributing financial assistance although completing the form is not an easy task. Each year, many students do not file the FAFSA or file it too late, missing valuable financial resources. The focus of this research was on students who file FAFSA late. The purpose of the study was two-foldto explore the relationship between the timing of FASFA filing and the characteristics of financial aid applicants, and to assess the impact of late filing on student finances.   Logistic regression analysis was used to examine how much of the variation in timing of FAFSA filing could be explained by students characteristics. The findings indicate late FAFSA filers tend to be in-state, male students, coming from single households, with weak high school academic performance. Focusing on low-income group, the study found the odds of filing late were nearly 2.8 times higher for in-state students than they were for out-of-state students. Being male increased the chances of late filing; the odds of filing late for low-income male students were 1.53 times higher than they were for low-income females. The impact of late FAFSA filing on student finances was assessed through linear regression analyses. The results show late filers received less grant aid but larger loan amounts. Compared to on time filers, late FAFSA filers received, on average, $2,815 less in grant aid and $662 more in loans.  The current study shed light on several key factors that make students more likely to miss the FAFSA deadlines. In addition, it demonstrated that late filing has major financial consequences for students and their families. The findings can be used by high school guidance offices, college administrators, state and federal governments, and higher education leaders concerned with improving college affordability.\",","12346":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12347":"\"description-provenance\": [","12348":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-07T09:00:28Z (GMT).

However, most AI systems work in a black-box fashion, which prevents the users from accessing the inner modules. This leads to two major problems(i) users have no idea when the underlying system will fail and thus it could fail abruptly without any warning or explanation, and (ii) users' lack of proficiency about the system could fail pushing the AI progress to its state-of-the-art. In this work, we address these problems in the following directions. First, we develop a failure prediction system, acting as an input filter. It raises a flag when the system is likely to fail with the given input. Second, we develop a portfolio computer vision system. It is able to predict which of the candidate computer vision systems perform the best on the input. Both systems have the benefit of only looking at the inputs without running the underlying vision systems. Besides, they are applicable to any vision system. By equipped such systems on different applications, we confirm the improved performance. Finally, instead of identifying errors, we develop more interpretable AI systems, which reveal the inner modules directly. We take two tasks as examples, words semantic matching and Visual Question Answering (VQA). In VQA, we take binary questions on abstract scenes as the first stage, then we extend to all question types on real images. In both cases, we take attention as an important intermediate output. By explicitly forcing the systems to attend correct regions, we ensure the correctness in the systems. We build a neural network to directly learn the semantic matching, instead of using the relation similarity between words. Across all the above directions, we show that by diagnosing errors and making more interpretable systems, we are able to improve the performance in the current models.\",","12393":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12394":"\"description-provenance\": [","12395":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-07T09:00:46Z (GMT).

These set of techniques inspired from the Lyapunov's direct method provide a clear insight into the system stability changes with a changing grid. The most attractive feature of these types of techniques is the heavy reduction in the computational burden by cutting down on the simulation time. These advancements were still aimed at analyzing the stability of a non-linear autonomous dynamical system and the existing power system perfectly fits that definition. Due to the changing renewable portfolio standards, the power system is undergoing serious structural and performance alterations. The whole idea of power system stability is changing and there is a major lack of work in the field of direct methods in keeping up with these changes.

There was a concern about implementing the one size fits all CRM. Therefore, public managers needed to understand the various public sector relationship types and to consider a relational, emotional and behavioral approach to the public-government relationship rather than the technical business management approach. The research here identifies some key distinctive typologies and key contextual relationship factors to better design a management approach that suits each typology. Some key relationship components are stakeholders, services, government role, service concept and relationship exchange. Reviewing the literature from the relationship lens, many studies have focused on understanding the components of a public-government relationship. The gap in the literature highlights the need for CRM models for the government sector functions, identifying the various contextual factors of the relationship, and a need to cater to the behavioral and emotional aspect of the relationship. The seven public-government relationship typology framework emerged from meta-synthesis of the literature review. The study uses UAE Federal government CRM, specifically the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP). Grounded theory methodology was used to explore the seven public-government factors. Twenty-four qualitative interviews were conducted. The examined relationships includeentrepreneurial, public beneficiary, social beneficiary, organizer, protector, arbitrator, and supporter. The findings aid practitioners in designing the public-government relationship management approach that suits the nature of each relationship and its context. Theoretically, the relationship is the new lens for improving customer service in the public sector and the private sector. This emphasizes that the one size fits all CRM approach needs to be changed to more of a human and personalized approach to managing relationship typologies that are altered based upon context, influential components, and key factors.

Landsat's role in scientific analysis has increased dramatically in recent years as a result of the open-access policy of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). However, this rich data record suffers from relatively low temporal resolution due to the 16-day revisit period of each Landsat satellite.   To estimate Landsat images at other points in time, researchers have proposed data-fusion approaches that combine existing Landsat data with images from other sensors, such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) from the Terra and Aqua satellites. MODIS provides daily revisits, however, with a spatial resolution that is significantly lower than that of Landsat.  Fusion of Landsat and MODIS is challenging because of differences in their spatial resolution, band designations, swath width, viewing angle and the noise level. Fusion is even more challenging for heterogeneous landscapes.  In the first part of our work, the multiresolution analysis offered by the wavelet transform was explored as  a suitable environment for Landsat and MODIS fusion. Our proposed Wavelet-based Spatiotemporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (WSTARFM) is the first model to merge Landsat and MODIS successfully. It handles the heterogeneity of the landscapes more effectively than the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) does. The system has been tested on simulated data and on actual data of two study areas in North Carolina. For a challenging heterogeneous study area near Greensboro, North Carolina, WSTARFM produced results with median R-squared values of 0.98 and 0.95 for the near-infrared band over deciduous forests and developed areas, respectively. Those results were obtained by withholding an actual Landsat image, and comparing it with a predicted version of the same image. These values represent an improvement over results obtained using the well-known STARFM technique. Similar improvements were obtained for the red band. For the second (homogeneous) study area, WSTARFM produced comparable prediction results to STARFM.  In the second part of our work, Landsat-MODIS fusion has been explored from the temporal perspective. The fusion is performed on the Landsat and MODIS per-pixel time series. A new Multisensor Adaptive Time Series Fitting Model (MATSFM) is proposed. MATSFM is the first model to use mapped MODIS values to guide the fitting applied to the sparse Landsat time series. MATSFM produced results with median R-squared of 0.98 over the NDVI images of the first heterogeneous study area compared to 0.97 produced by STARFM. For the second study area, MATSFM also produced better prediction accuracy than STARFM.\",","12526":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12527":"\"description-provenance\": [","12528":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-08T09:00:42Z (GMT).

Most NAD(P) dependent redox enzymes show a preference of either NADP or NAD as an electron acceptor or donor depending on their unique metabolic roles. In biocatalysis, the low enzymatic activities with unnatural coenzymes have made it difficult to replace costly NADP with economically advantageous NAD or other biomimetic coenzyme for catalysis. This is a significant challenge that must be addressed should in vitro biocatalysis be a viable option for the practical production of low-value biocommodities (i.e., biohydrogen). There is a significant need to first address the coenzyme selectivity of the NADP-dependent dehydrogenases and evolve mutated enzymes that accept biomimetic coenzymes. This is a major focus of this dissertation. Establishment of efficient screening methods to identify beneficial mutants from an enzymatic library is the most challenging task of coenzyme engineering of dehydrogenases. To fine tune the coenzyme preference of dehydrogenases to allow economical hydrogen production, we developed a double-layer Petri-dish based screening method to identify positive mutant of the Moorella thermoacetica 6PGDH (Moth6PGDH) with a more than 4,278-fold reversal of coenzyme selectivity from NADP+ to NAD+. This method was also used to screen the thermostable mutant of a highly active glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase from the mesophilic host Zymomonas mobilis. The resulting best mutant Mut 4-1 showed a more than 124-fold improvement of half-life times at 60oC without compromising the specific activity. The screening method was further upgraded for the coenzyme engineering of Thermotaga maritima 6PGDH (Tm6PGDH) on the biomimetic coenzyme NMN+. Through six-rounds of directed evolution and screening, the best mutant showed a more than 50-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency on NMN+ and a more than 6-fold increased hydrogen productivity rate from 6-phosphogluconate and NMN+ compared to those of wild-type enzyme. Together, these results demonstrated the effectiveness of screening methods developed in this research for coenzyme engineering of NAD(P) dependent dehydrogenase and efficient use of the less costly coenzyme in ivSB based hydrogen production.\",","12570":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12571":"\"description-provenance\": [","12572":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-12T09:00:15Z (GMT).

Full-scale experiments and high-fidelity simulations are restrictive due to the prohibitively high cost, while the model-scale experiments and low-fidelity calculations miss key flow physics of unsteady high Reynolds number flows. A hybrid RANS/LES turbulence model integrated with transition formulation is developed and tested by a surrogate model problem through joint experimental and computational fluid dynamics approaches. The model problem consists of a circular cylinder for generating coherent unsteadiness and a downstream airfoil in the cylinder wake. The cylinder flow is subcritical, with a Reynolds number of 64,000 based upon the cylinder diameter. The quantitative dynamics of vortex shedding and Reynolds stresses in the cylinder near wake were well captured, owing to the turbulence-resolving large eddy simulation method that was invoked in the wake. The power spectrum density of velocity components showed that the flow fluctuations were well-maintained in cylinder wake towards airfoil and the hybrid model switched between RANS/LES mode outside boundary layer as expected. According to the experimental and simulation results, the airfoil encountered local flow angle variations up to \u00b150 degrees, and the turbulent airfoil boundary layer remained attached. Inspecting the boundary layer profiles over one shedding cycle, the oscillation about mean profile resembled the Stokes layer with zero mean. Further processing the data through phase-averaging technique found phase lags along the chordwise locations and both the phase-averaged and mean profiles collapsed into the Law of Wall in the range of 0 < y+ < 50. The features of high blade loading fluctuations due to unsteadiness and transitional boundary layers are of interest in the aerodynamic studies of full-scale wind turbine blades, making the model problem a comprehensive benchmark case for future model development and validation.\",","12616":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12617":"\"description-provenance\": [","12618":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-12T09:00:24Z (GMT).

Multiple health risks are associated with obesity such as cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes. \tAdvances in mass spectrometry have made wide scale proteomic studies possible and are redefining cell and molecular biology. One such area of that has become of considerable interest is protein acetylation which is observed in most cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, gene expression, subcellular localization, metabolism, muscle contraction, protein stability, apoptosis, and more. Metabolic proteins are highly susceptible to acetylation with almost all showing the capacity to be acetylated.  \tOur research, using an obese mouse model fed a chronic high fat diet and a lean control mouse model fed a standard chow diet, showed numerous differences in the acetylome between obese and lean animals in a fasted state. As well as, differences in the acetylome's of both animal models upon receiving a high fat meal. We showed that almost every mitochondrially located metabolic protein in obese animals is hyper-acetylated in a fasted state compared to lean animals and that upon feeding lean animals have a greater response in the change to their metabolic acetylome. We show that in the fed state lean and obese mice have almost completely different acetylomic profiles of mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolic proteins.

The first manuscript defines metacognitive social justice through an extensive literature review from prominent social justice scholars and theorists to find common themes that either explicitly or subtly permeate social justice content. Drawing from theory and empirical data, the first manuscript provides a foundation of this cognitive process that is relatable to all social justice scholarship, defining cognitive common ground. The themes found across the literature can be distilled to four metacognitive attributes found in \\"social justice thinking\\"(1) self-awareness through consciousness-raising, (2) value in the narratives of others, (3) awareness of unseen forces, and (4) questioning historical origins or intents.  The second manuscript is a qualitative analysis of the perception of self- proclaimed social justice thinkers, exploring how they define 'social justice thinking' and the role it plays in their daily choices and decision-making. Through thoroughly coded and analyzed transcripts of one-on-one, semi-structured interviews, this manuscript explores three other emergent themes of action, discomfort and community, as a well as the need for developing social justice thinkers, and highlights significant connections to the attributes in the first manuscript.  The third manuscript is a detailed description of the development of the metacognitive social justice survey for college undergraduates, a psychometric instrument designed to measure the metacognitive social justice attributes in individuals described in the theoretical manuscript. The instrument was found to be increasing in quantitative validity through two exploratory factor analyzes (EFA) with still room for improvement. Drawing on the questions developed so far, a final version of this psychometric instrument will provide a snapshot of what metacognitive  social justice attributes are found in undergraduate classes and potentially to what extent. This is the first edition of the instrument, with the idea that the instrument should be ever evolving, becoming more accurate and valid, and carefully reworded for different audiences beyond college undergraduates.\",","12705":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12706":"\"description-provenance\": [","12707":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-13T09:00:19Z (GMT).

Our anomaly detection method consists of two primary componentsdimensionality reduction through projection and Gaussian process (GP) regression. We use non-metric multidimensional scaling to project a partially observed and potentially non-definite covariance matrix into a low dimensional manifold. The projection is estimated in such a way that positively correlated sensors are close to each other and negatively correlated sensors are distant. We then fit a Gaussian process given these positions and use it to make predictions at our observed locations. Because of the large amount of data we wish to consider, we develop methods to scale GP estimation by taking advantage of the replication structure in the data. Finally, we introduce a semi-supervised method to incorporate expert input into a GP model.

However, it is difficult to gain access to the fermentable sugars in lignocellulose, and this problem is principally associated with limited enzyme accessibility. Hence, biomass pretreatments that destroy native cell wall structure and allows enzyme access are required for effective biomass conversion techniques. This research studied two novel pretreatment methods on two wood species1) a deep eutectic solvent (DES) that, under heat, swells lignocellulose and partially solubilizes cell wall materials by causing breakage of lignin-carbohydrate linkages and depolymerization of the biomass components, and 2) a chelator-mediated Fenton reaction (CMF) that chemically modifies the nanostructure of the cell wall through a non-enzymatic cell wall deconstruction. After pretreatment, utilizing analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, wide angle x-ray scattering, and gel permeation chromatography, samples were analyzed for chemical and structural changes in the solubilized and residual materials.     After single stage DES (choline-chloride-glycerol) and two stage, CMF followed by DES pretreatments, lignin/carbohydrate fractions were recovered, leaving a cellulose-rich fraction with reduced lignin and hemicellulose content as determined by compositional analysis.  Lignin and heteropolysaccharide removal by DES was quantified and the aromatic-rich solubilized biopolymer fragments were analyzed as water insoluble high molecular weight fractions and water-ethanol soluble low molecular weight compounds.  After pretreatment for the hardwood sample, enzyme digestibility reached a saccharification yield of 78% (a 13-fold increase) for the two stage (DES/CMF) pretreated biomass even with the presence of some lignin and xylan remained on the pretreated fiber; only a 9-fold increase was observed after the other sequence of CMF followed by DES treatment. Single stage CMF treatment or single stage DES pretreatment improved 5-fold glucose yield compared to the untreated sample for the hardwood sample.  The enhancement of enzymatic saccharification for softwood was less than that of hardwoods with only 4-fold increase for the sequence CMF followed by DES treatment. The other sequence of treatments reached up to 2.5-fold improvement. A similar result was determined for the single stage CMF treatment while the single stage DES treatment reached only 1.4-fold increase compared to the untreated softwood. Hence, all these pretreatments presented different degrees of biopolymer removal from the cell wall and subsequent digestibility levels; synergistic effects were observed for hardwood particularly in the sequence DES followed by CMF treatment while softwoods remained relatively recalcitrant. Overall, these studies revealed insight into two novel methods to enhance lignocellulosic digestibility of biomass adding to the methodology to deconstruct cell walls for fermentable sugars.     General Audience Abstract Wood is a valuable material that can be used to produce liquid biofuels. Wood main components are biopolymers cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin that form a complex structure. Nature has locked up cellulose in a protective assembly that needs to be destroyed to gain access to cellulose, convert it to glucose and then ferment it to bioalcohol. This process is principally associated with limited enzyme accessibility. Therefore, biomass pretreatments that deconstruct native cell wall structure and allow enzyme access are required for effective biomass conversion techniques. This research studied two novel pretreatment methods on two wood species1) a deep eutectic solvent called glyceline that, under heat, swells wood and partially solubilizes cell wall materials by causing breakage of bonds and converting it into smaller molecules (monomers and oligomers), and 2) a chelator-mediated Fenton system (CMF) that chemically modifies the structure of the cell wall. Pretreatments were tested individually and in sequence in sweetgum and southern yellow pine. After pretreatments, utilizing analytical techniques, fractions were investigated for chemical and structural changes in the solubilized and residual materials.  Treated wood samples were exposed to enzymatic conversion.  A maximum 78% of glucose yield was obtained for the glyceline followed by CMF pretreated wood. For yellow pine only a 24% of glucose yield was obtained for the CMF followed by glyceline treatment. All these pretreatments presented different degrees of biopolymer removal from the cell wall and subsequent enzyme conversion levels. Overall, these studies revealed insight into two novel methods to enhance wood conversion adding to the methodology to deconstruct cell walls for fermentable sugars.\",","12839":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12840":"\"description-provenance\": [","12841":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-16T09:00:14Z (GMT).

It is a challenging problem due to the complexity of everyday scenes. This problem possesses a great importance for many trending applications, such as self-driving cars.  Previous research in text detection has been dominated by multi-stage sequential approaches which suffer from many limitations including error propagation from one stage to the next.  Another line of work is the use of deep learning techniques. Some of the deep methods used for text detection are box detection models and fully convolutional models. Box detection models suffer from the nature of the annotations, which may be too coarse to provide detailed supervision. Fully convolutional models learn to generate pixel-wise maps that represent the location of text instances in the input image. These models suffer from the inability to create accurate word level annotations without heavy post processing.  To overcome these aforementioned problems we propose a novel end-to-end system based on a mix of novel deep learning techniques. The proposed system consists of an attention model, based on a new deep architecture proposed in this dissertation, followed by a deep network based on Faster-RCNN. The attention model produces a high-resolution map that indicates likely locations of text instances. A novel aspect of the system is an early fusion step that merges the attention map directly with the input image prior to word-box prediction. This approach suppresses but does not eliminate contextual information from consideration. Progressively larger models were trained in 3 separate phases. The resulting system has demonstrated an ability to detect text under difficult conditions related to illumination, resolution, and legibility. The system has exceeded the state of the art on the ICDAR 2013 and COCO-Text benchmarks with F-measure values of 0.875 and 0.533, respectively.\",","12885":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12886":"\"description-provenance\": [","12887":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-20T09:00:16Z (GMT).

Etiology is heterogeneous, but commonly involves inflammation arising from impairment of normal tissue homeostasis and/or function. A cycle of low-grade inflammation and global tissue degradation causes alteration of tissue morphology and function via primary mechanisms or inability to withstand physiological forces. Current therapies variably ameliorate symptoms but do not modify progression. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have multi-modal properties but are ineffective in ameliorating equine OA. However, anti-inflammatory activities of bone marrow derived MSCs (BMSCs) are enhanced by three-dimensional spheroid culture so equine BMSC (eBMSC) spheroids could inhibit intra-articular inflammation.   The overarching hypothesis is that eBMSCs can be enhanced to produce an allogeneic eBMSC therapy that inhibits intra-articular inflammation. In vitro experiments compared differences in anti-inflammatory phenotype between spheroid and traditionally cultured monolayer eBMSCs, the viability and health of eBMSC spheroids administered through needles, and the effects of allogeneic donor on the anti-inflammatory potential of eBMSC spheroids. A model of equine LPS induced synovitis was used to investigate anti-inflammatory efficacy of spheroid eBMSCs compared to placebo or monolayer eBMSCs in vivo.   eBMSCs aggregate into spheroids that have stable stem cell marker expression with increased secretion and gene expression of IL-6 and PGE2, and gene expression of SDF-1 and TSG-6. IFN\ud835\udefe and TNF\u03b1 were not produced by eBMSC spheroids and IL-10 production varied between individuals. Spheroids maintain higher viability and lower senescence than monolayer eBMSCs after injection through a needle and form in high-throughput culture without detrimental effects on expression of TSG-6, IL-6 and PGE synthases that denote an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Additionally, there is significant variation in this phenotype depending on the eBMSC donor. eBMSC spheroids reduced total nucleated cell counts and objective lameness measurements at peak levels of intra-articular inflammation compared to monolayer cultured eBMSCs in vivo.   In summary, spheroids increase anti-inflammatory potential of eBMSCs and are practical for clinical use. Increased anti-inflammatory efficacy was demonstrated in a model of in vivo inflammation. This dissertation provides an understanding of the anti-inflammatory activities of eBMSC spheroids that can be used to develop an OA therapy.\",","12929":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12930":"\"description-provenance\": [","12931":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2018-01-12T07:00:20Z (GMT).

Using technologies becomes a way to 'perform' a person's sense of him or herself.  This insight serves historians because it suggests that users, not just important inventors, drive technological change.  My study also suggests that the relationship people have with technology (and how they use it to form their identities) has historical genealogies.  Engineers and business people will also find my history useful because the notion of 'performative use' means that people's views of themselves can influence the way they adopt and employ technologies.  Policy scholars will gain from my study because I show that the way people use technology to understand themselves has consequences in determining how they participate in controversies over science and technology policy.  This narrative begins in the eighteenth century by analyzing how elites like Benjamin Rush viewed the agricultural practices of German farmers, regarded by many in the upper classes as backwards.  I show how observances of German farmers by elites created a pattern repeated throughout American history where rural people would use technology to perform their identities for an outside observer.  In addition, I describe an identity, which I call 'German agrarianism,' and contend that this rural self-image migrated to the Midwest when German farmers moved westward.  German agrarianism had several important features including the association of morality with family-based production practices, an obsession with owning personal property, the inclusion of women in farming and land ownership, and the practice of performing identity through the use of material objects.  Next, I describe a rural identity with English origins, one that other scholars have named 'Jeffersonian agrarianism.'  This Jeffersonian identity saw farmers as heroes who conquered the frontier, preserved American democracy, and supported less moral urban dwellers.  I argue that Jeffersonian agrarianism in the nineteenth century began to reject technological and social change and that this view of rural people as anti-modern has influenced the way observers of rural life have viewed farmers up to the present.   This study then analyzes the rural-urban conflict of the 1920s, contending that farmers used technologies to develop their own rural modern identity, which I call 'rural capitalistic modernity.'  Farmers used technology this way to combat a version of modernity, which I name 'urban industrialism.'  This modern identity, arising from the cities, advocated improving rural life by making farms resemble urban factories.  This factory model threatened German and Jeffersonian rural identities that existed prior to the 1920s because it removed the family as the center of production and advocated work processes that took control and property ownership away from farmers.  In addition, urban industrialism saw farmers as backward and in need of reform, which offended farmers who saw themselves in heroic terms as a result of Jeffersonian agrarianism.  I argue that many rural people in the 1920s used technology to perform an identity of rural capitalistic modernity as a means of combating these urban efforts to restructure farms as factories and stereotype farmers as 'yokels' or 'rubes.'  This rural modern identity became reinforced during the Cold War because the farmer saw Soviet collectivized agriculture as posing the same threats as previous urban industrialism.  In addition, the way farmers used technology to reinforce their views of themselves as modern became valuable to government actors in the United States who saw increased agricultural production as a weapon in defeating the Soviet Union.    By the 1970s, farmers formed an identity called 'rural ultramodernity' in which they began to think of themselves as more modern than urban dwellers because of their design and use of advanced technologies and their role as producers in the global food network.  This ultramodern identity incorporates aspects of previous rural identities, including an obsession with combating urban stereotypes of farmers as 'hicks.'  In addition, this rural ultramodern identity views farmers as having an inborn modernity inherited from previous generations of farmers.  I argue that this ultramodern way farmers think of themselves explains why rural people in the Midwest have embraced the erection of wind turbines, unlike residents of other regions in the U.S.   From a policy perspective, this study also contends that debates over science and technology, such as efforts to render agriculture more sustainable and organic, are impacted by unexpressed fundamental views about nature and morality.  Statements about these controversies often take the form of proxy arguments that sound 'rational' but mask these unstated ideas, and they often alienate those with opposing views.  Current debates over genetically modified organisms, from a rural perspective, are actually unspoken clashes over rural ultramodern and organic identities hidden by 'objective' points made by both sides involving science or economics.  This study also challenges the common notion that technology and production are male domains by showing how both men and women have used technology to construct their identities as producers on Midwest farms.  This insight illustrates how disagreements over gender roles underlie current policy debates about agriculture.  Farmers view organic discourse as threatening rural women's identities as modern producers by framing farming as an immoral, industrial, and male domination of a moral and female nature.  Rural people view organic discourse as carrying on the tradition of urban industrialism, which saw farmers as backwards and farm women as unhappy and occupying an exclusively domestic sphere.  This study suggests that any effort to reform agriculture must include farmers and incorporate the way rural people use technologies to form and reinforce their identities.  At the same time, the conclusion advocates for a new rural identity that avoids farmer's tendencies to view all technologies as 'progress' regardless of their environmental or social impacts.\",","12974":"\"description-degree\": \"PHD\",","12975":"\"description-provenance\": [","12976":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2018-02-02T07:00:27Z (GMT).

The proposed model consists of the framework for the structural design and analysis of long slender beam like structures, e.g., wings, wind turbine blades, and helicopter rotor blades, etc. The main feature consists of the addition of the coupling between axial and bending with torsional effects that may arise when using composite materials and the coupling stemming from the inhomogeneity in cross-sections of any arbitrary geometry. This type of modeling approach allows for an accurate yet computationally inexpensive representation of a general class of beam-like structures.   The framework for beam analysis consists of main two parts, cross-sectional analysis of the beam sections and then using this section analysis to build up the finite element model. The cross-sectional analysis is performed in order to predict the structural properties for composite sections, which are used for the beam model.   The thesis consists of the model to validate the convergence of the element size required for the cross-sectional analysis. This follows by the validation of the shell models of constant cross-section to assess the performance of the beam elements, including coupling terms. This framework also has the capability of calculating the strains and displacements at various points of the cross-section. Natural frequencies and mode shapes are compared for different cases of increasing complexity with those available in the papers. Then, the framework is used to analyze the wing of a drone and compare the results to a model developed in NASTRAN.\",","13018":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","13019":"\"description-provenance\": [","13020":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-06T13:34:15Z (GMT).

To improve the accuracy of the early detection, there is a need to deeply understand the mechanism of EOC progression and the interaction between cancer cells with their unique microenvironment. Therefore, this work investigated the metabolic shift in the mouse model for progressive ovarian cancer, and evaluated the effects of hypoxic environment, spheroid formation as well as stromal vascular fractions (SVF) on the metabolic shift, proliferation rate, drug resistance and protein markers in functional categories. The results demonstrated an increasingly glycolytic nature of MOSE cells as they progress from a tumorigenic (MOSE-L) to a highly aggressive phenotype (MOSE-FFL), and also showed changes in metabolism during ovarian cancer spheroid formation with SVF under different oxygen levels. More specifically, the hypoxic environment enhanced glycolytic shift by upregulating the glucose uptake and lactate secretion, and the spheroid formation affected the cellular metabolism by increasing the lactate secretion to acidify local environments, modulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules to enhance cell motility and spheroids disaggregation, and up-regulating invasiveness markers and stemness makers to promote ovarian cancer aggressive potential. Hypoxia and spheroid formation decreased ovarian cancer cells growth but increased the chemoresistance, which leads to the promotion of aggressiveness and metastasis potential of ovarian cancer. SVF co-cultured spheroids further increased the glycolytic shift of the heterogeneous of ovarian cancer spheroids, induced the aggressive phenotype by elevating the corresponding protein markers. Decreasing the glycolytic shift and suppression of the proteins/pathways may be used to inhibit aggressiveness or metastatic potential of ovarian cancer heterogeneous of ovarian cancer spheroids, induced the aggressive phenotype by elevating the corresponding protein markers.

The resulting War Powers Resolution (WPR) sought to inject Congress back into the decision-making process, yet no President has ever acknowledged its constitutionality. The initial debates around the WPR revealed four major lines of argument on the balance of war powers; three of those continued to be made over the next 40 years, as Presidents from both political parties deployed U.S. forces abroad, often without Congressional authorization. This study analyzed the prevalence and distribution of those lines of argument in the U.S. Senate over the Republican Administration of President George W. Bush and the Democratic Administration of President Barack Obama. Both administrations were involved in multiple deployments of U.S. forces abroad, and experienced opposition from both parties. The study found that Democrats displayed consistency across both administrations, indicating a preference for institutional loyalty in supporting compliance with the WPR, whereas Republicans tended to support the status quo. In addition, the study found that Senators from both parties acknowledged the rapidly changing nature of warfare as new technologies mostly remove U.S. armed forces from harm's way even as they conduct lethal strikes. What effect this has on Congress's ability and willingness to further check executive war powers remains to be seen, but it is clear that the debate is far from over.\",","13146":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","13147":"\"description-provenance\": [","13148":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-11T09:00:36Z (GMT).

This thesis includes two studies that develop new formulations to compute the optimum cycle length of isolated intersections, considering measures of effectiveness such as vehicle delay, fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions. Additionally, both studies validate the Webster model against simulated data. The microscopic simulation software, INTEGRATION, was used to simulate two-phase and four-phase isolated intersections over a range of cycle lengths, traffic demand levels, and signal timing lost times. Intersection delay, fuel consumption levels, and emissions of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were derived from the simulation software. The cycle lengths that minimized the various measures of effectiveness were then used to develop the proposed formulations. The first research effort entailed recalibrating the Webster model to the simulated data to develop a new delay, fuel consumption, and emissions formulation. However, an additional intercept was incorporated to the new formulations to enhance the Webster model. The second research effort entailed updating the proposed model against four study intersections. To account for the stochastic and random nature of traffic, the simulations were then run with twenty random seeds per scenario. Both efforts noted its estimated cycle lengths to minimize fuel consumption and emissions were longer than cycle lengths optimized for vehicle delay only. Secondly, the simulation results manifested an overestimation in optimum cycle lengths derived from the Webster model for high vehicle demands.\",","13190":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","13191":"\"description-provenance\": [","13192":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-11T09:00:50Z (GMT).

The existing conditions of the spaces we move through often impact the way we experience architecture.  Whether we transition between spaces by walking, cycling, running, driving a car, or riding the train, we face many challenges on a daily basis.  As it is crucial that designers understand how one single person or a group of people are able to move efficiently through the various spaces, my thesis research aimed at to exploring the following question         How can architecture enrich the experience of moving from one space to another, and bring people together into a shared space in a meaningful way?           In response to the above question, I would like to research the ways in which mobility, in both vertical and horizontal dimensions, can create a positive and meaningful impact when bringing people together in a commercial-cultural type space.  Therefore, my focus within this topic will be an exploration of how architecture may enrich this human experience, which should begin from the moment people arrive at the site, as this is a major space component of my project. Proceeding the moment we enter the first space of a building, and subsequently the different spaces within the building, and finally exiting the site.             To accomplish the above aim, I have chosen to design a performing arts facility in which the main space will be an opera house in a metropolitan setting.  Since the District of Columbia already has two such venues, I landed on the idea of providing the City of Alexandria with one of its very own.  I propose The Alexandria Performing Arts Center, located on a waterfront site, that will include an opera house with a capacity of 1,400.

The research provides an overview of U.S. policies towards Latin America from the Spanish-American War through the collapse of the Soviet Union; and from the post Cold War era through Barack Obama's presidency. The focus is on the U.S.-Latin American policies during and after the Cold War. There is a review of China and Russia's engagement of the region both during and after the Cold War. Finally there is a case study on the change of the U.S-Cuba policy and possible consequences.\",","13274":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","13275":"\"description-provenance\": [","13276":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-12T09:00:35Z (GMT).

The 3.5 mile long twin structure includes the world's first underwater tunnel between two man-made islands. Throughout its 60 years in service, the harsh environment along the Virginia coast has taken its toll on the main load carrying girders. Concrete spalling has exposed prestressing strands within the girders allowing corrosion to spread. Some of the more damaged girders have prestressing strands that have completely severed due to the extensive corrosion. The deterioration has caused select girders to fail the necessary load ratings. The structure acts as an evacuation route for the coast and is a main link for the local Norfolk Naval Base and surrounding industry. Because of these constraints, load posting is not a viable option.  Live load testing of five spans was performed to investigate the behavior of the damaged spans. Innovative techniques were used during the load test including a wireless system to measure strains. Two different deflection systems were implemented on the spans, which were located about one mile offshore. The deflection data was later compared head to head. From the load test results, live load distribution factors were developed for both damaged and undamaged girders. The data was also used by the local Department of Transportation to validate computer models in an effort to help pass the load rating. Overall, this research was at the forefront of the residual strength of prestressed concrete girders and the testing of in-service bridges.\",","13318":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","13319":"\"description-provenance\": [","13320":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-13T09:00:12Z (GMT).

The United States, already facing strategic overreach due to conflicts in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, will face enormous difficulties in engaging militarily against a multitude of violent non-state actors. Smart power, a selective employment of hard and soft power applications, presents an opportunity to limit and deter violent non-state actors in a resourceconstrained environment.

The announcement prompted the cessation of beef imports by the largest traditional beef trading partners with the United States, resulting in immediately realized losses to the U.S. industry. This thesis evaluates the short- and long-term impact this discovery and subsequent policies had on the global beef market. We utilize market share analysis to examine the loss realized by the U.S. over a 13-year time frame, then employ a log-linear gravity model with fixed effects to quantify the changes in global export and import values and quantities using a novel bilateral trade database spanning 16 years. We find that the policies implemented immediately on discovery of the single BSE case were often slow to be rescinded even though additional related cases of BSE were not found in the United States. We also find that the removal of said policies does not guarantee full reentry of U.S. beef products, even after a lag of several years. Finally, we find that both traditional and newly emerging suppliers of beef and beef products contributed to the slow reentry of U.S. beef within critical markets. The losses and implications of the aforementioned policies detailed within this thesis suggests a different approach be undertaken by regulators should another similar threat to the U.S. food supply emerge in the future.\",","13493":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","13494":"\"description-provenance\": [","13495":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-26T09:00:23Z (GMT).

The investigation begins with the analysis of ruins as the result of a natural process that strips down a building of secondary components and leaves the exposed soul of the architecture.  As a specific example, the thesis explores the Roman ruins, how they exude their cultural history and often how they express the initial architectural intent and identity.  The ambition of Rome is carried to the harmony of Florence and finally to the embodiment of harmonious ambition in Michelangelo.     His work constantly achieved an ambition in creating a new identity with each masterpiece while always attaining a beautiful moment of harmony.  The thesis explores not just the wonders of Michelangelo's life, but his inspirations and mastery of ancient traditions as well as his influence on the world after him.  At the conclusion of the exploration, I propose a place of learning that both honors Michelangelo and his resonance throughout history and creates a new harmonious ambition.\",","13581":"\"description-degree\": \"MARCH\",","13582":"\"description-provenance\": [","13583":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-27T09:00:33Z (GMT).

C88 is popular due to its high quality and taste, and it is used commonly in China's expanding potato chip processing market. The purpose of this study is to examine adoption of C88 in the Yunnan Province, its value chain, and economic impacts.    The analysis indicates that C88 is still popular with 16.8% of the potato area in Yunnan devoted to this variety in late spring 2015. To examine factors affecting household decisions to adopt and the intensity of their adoption, village adoption, household adoption, and household intensity of adoption were assessed. A village's proximity to a metropolitan county was the most important factor explaining adoption and intensity of adoption. Households in villages closer to a metropolitan county disadopted at higher rates than those farther away.   To quantify the economic benefits of C88 adoption, an economic surplus analysis was conducted. Total surplus changes ranged from $2 to 3 billion indicating significant economic benefits to consumers and producers in Yunnan.\",","13672":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","13673":"\"description-provenance\": [","13674":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-31T09:00:37Z (GMT).

It will assess the efficiency of this strategy in reducing HWA populations and improving the health of hemlock forests.  The project was started in 2010 and data were collected annually through 2016. The project spanned three sites in three different states (KY, WV, and TN). Results show that tree health has generally declined across all sites for each year. HWA population index values are highly variable and are more strongly influenced by the occurrence of low winter temperatures than by treatment effect. Cross-correlation analysis of tree health and HWA population, revealed characteristics of their temporal relationship. In two of the three sites, tree health lagged up to three years behind changes in HWA population, and HWA populations lagged approximately one year behind changes in tree health. L. nigrinus did not establish at any site as of 2016. The lack of sustained recovery of the beetle may be attributable to the occurrence of extremely cold temperatures during the winters of 2014 and 2015 which produced subsequent crashes in the HWA population at two of the three sites. In TN, the L. nigrinus population may have never established due to a decline in the HWA population shortly after release.\",","13720":"\"description-degree\": \"MSLFS\",","13721":"\"description-provenance\": [","13722":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-01-31T09:00:57Z (GMT).

This study was designed to address objectives related to hatch-year (HY) ROST behavior and survival in response to human and non-human activities and environmental variables at CCNS. Behavioral data showed that disturbance, specifically human and non-human activities, were related to increased HY ROST locomotion (flying and walking). We also found that environmental variables, including day of season and time of day were related to increased locomotion. Flock-level HY ROST begging behavior was decreased in the presence of human disturbance, but we did not see the same effect at the individual level. We found no evidence that the observed behavioral effect of disturbance resulted in decreased residency, recruitment, or staging duration of HY ROST at CCNS. Our work demonstrates that disturbance events around staging flocks have behavioral consequences, but it is unknown whether HY ROST behavioral responses to disturbances are great enough to impact survival after departure from CCNS. A conservative and proactive management strategy to minimize the potential for negative carryover effects on survival should limit ROST exposure to disturbance, particularly human activities, by exclosing staging sites between mid-July\ufffd\\"mid-September to encompass the period of time when the highest number of ROST use CCNS.\",","13768":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","13769":"\"description-provenance\": [","13770":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-01T09:00:20Z (GMT).

It is a compilation of a series of gestures made on behalf of Architecture. These gestures  confront the materiality of Architecture to reveal the imprints beyond what makes the material exist according to the law of its nature, the imprints that reveal the material as an imprint for the human desire, the human will, and the human wish, for the material as a tool of representation and interpretation, thus the human thoughts, the human purpose and the human work.  Explained in terms of space or environment, in terms of form or function, Architecture is never quite fully and satisfactorily understood. These terms reveal their anxiety about the mundane and the prosaic in the material constituents of Architecture. They tend to inadvertently distance themselves from the material seeking to appeal to the conceptual.    As much significance as the conceptual and the intangible contribute to the principles of Architecture, this thesis revels in the tactile, the vivid, in what is all together sense perceptible, the real, the present. As much as it regards the secrets that reside in the divine and in the spiritual, it is eager to find them embodied in its material reality. Truth, poetry, beauty, all things conceptual, that reside in abstract immaterial form beyond reach in the upper ethers, are afforded by Architecture to exist within a corpus.   Without the material imagination, one is prone to participating in the exercise of Architecture, with undue weight given to its form, its shape, its geometry, to how readily it will serve a functional need, a need that seems to reduce life around it to that specific act, overlooking what will eventually reside alongside us in matter.   Without the material imagination, one is prone to readily accepting what modern technology or modern alchemy can afford this exercise of Architecture thereby readily adapting techniques and systems without careful thought. Without the material imagination, one is prone to overlooking the prima materia1 and the primordial architectural gestures, and thereby unduly and unwisely willing the material to conform to the conceptual.  Without the material imagination, one is prone to overlooking what is in the nature of a material and thereby missing what its inherent beauty informs us.  Along with trying to understand the iconic elements of Architecture, this thesis is also an investigation in its materiality. It is an exercise in trying to understand what confronting the materiality of an artifice reveals. It is an attempt to define architecture by man's endeavour to understand the creature, to understand the material presence, to unravel the mysteries of the material constitution and organization.\",","13854":"\"description-degree\": \"MARCH\",","13855":"\"description-provenance\": [","13856":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-01T09:00:59Z (GMT).

Accounting for sex in spatially explicit methods, which directly incorporate locations of captures into the model, increased precision in density estimates by reducing individual heterogeneity in capture probability. The spatial models also demonstrated that males moved larger distances than females and had slightly higher detection rates. Ocelot populations remained relatively stable over time at the long term sites. My study produced methodologically rigorous abundance/density estimates for ocelots in Belize and the first ever ocelot survival estimates.\",","13898":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","13899":"\"description-provenance\": [","13900":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-01T09:01:24Z (GMT).

Targeted modifications can be introduced while repairing double strand breaks (DSBs), induced by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The DSB is repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), and the repair is commonly processed through NHEJ because it is the dominant repair pathway in most cell types. The goal of this study is to modulate DNA repair system of somatic cells to increase the frequency of homology-directed repair (HDR) through HR by chemical treatment and the frequency of NHEJ by serum starvation. CRISPR/Cas9 systems targeting RAG2 gene and donor DNA to replace endogenous RAG2 were transfected into porcine fetal fibroblast (PFF) cells and the cells were treated with various chemicals that were known to inhibit NHEJ or stimulate HR. Among the chemical treated groups, cells treated with thymidine showed an average of 5.85-fold increase in HDR compared to the control group; the difference ranged from 1.37 to 9.59. There was no positive effect on the frequency of HDR after treating transfected cells with other chemicals. Placing PFFs under low amount of serum (serum deprivation) could enrich the cells in G0/G1 phase, but there was little difference in the frequency of NHEJ. Our results indicate that modulating DNA repair pathways during CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting could change the outcome of the targeted events.\",","13940":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","13941":"\"description-provenance\": [","13942":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-02T09:00:16Z (GMT).

Thermal pollution from urban stormwater runoff threatens the livelihoods of cold-water fish species, like trout, among other species of wildlife. In order to reduce thermal pollution loading to its streams, a municipality or regulatory authority must first identify the sources of thermal pollution in its waterbodies. This study predicts areas within an urban watershed in the Town of Blacksburg, VA that may be sources of thermal pollution in stormwater runoff by investigating indicators of thermal pollution potential (TPP) through and analysis of land cover types and runoff flow patterns in a geographic information system (GIS) environment.

SNeuPI consists of an ionization chamber and a logarithmic electrometer circuit. The Rev. 1 SNeuPI electrometer prototype does not function as designed. A Rev. 2 electrometer circuit must be designed and its performance characterized across specified operating temperature and input current ranges.  This document presents a design topology for the Rev. 2 electrometer and a derivation of the theoretical circuit transfer function. Component selection and layout are discussed. A range of predicted operating input currents is calculated using modeled neutral density data for a range of local times, altitudes, and latitudes corresponding to the conditions expected for the Lower Atmosphere/Ionosphere Coupling Experiment (LAICE) CubeSat mission. Laboratory test setups for measurements performed both under vacuum and at atmospheric pressure are documented in detail. Test procedures are presented to characterize the performance of the Rev. 2 electrometer at a range of controlled operating temperatures. The results of these tests are then extrapolated in order to predict the operation of the circuit at specified temperatures outside of the range controllable under laboratory test conditions. The logarithmic conformance, accuracy, sensitivity, power consumption, and deviations from expected response of the circuit are characterized. The results validate the electrometer for use under its expected flight conditions.\",","14067":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14068":"\"description-provenance\": [","14069":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-03T09:00:23Z (GMT).

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is orexigenic and promotes adipogenesis in both birds and mammals, although mechanisms in adipose tissue are unclear. The first objective was thus to evaluate effects of NPY on chick preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation. Preadipocytes were treated with NPY and gene expression and cellular proliferation were evaluated. Cells were also treated with NPY during differentiation and harvested during the later stages. With increased gene expression of proliferation markers in preadipocytes, and during differentiation increased expression of adipogenesis-associated factors, increased lipid accumulation, and increased activity of an adipogenic enzyme, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, results suggest that NPY may enhance preadipocyte activity and adipogenesis and promotes lipid accumulation throughout chicken adipocyte differentiation. Another appetite-regulatory peptide, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), is anorexigenic and mediates lipolysis in adipose tissue, but effects on fat in avians are unreported. The second objective was thus to determine the effects of exogenous \u03b1-MSH on adipose tissue physiology in broiler chicks. Chicks were intraperitoneally injected with \u03b1-MSH and adipose tissue and plasma collected. Cells isolated from abdominal fat of a different set of chicks were treated with \u03b1-MSH. Results suggest that \u03b1-MSH increases lipolysis and reduces adipogenesis in chick adipose tissue.

Large hail produced by severe thunderstorms is a major focus of this mission. An algorithm known as the Maximum Estimated Size of Hail (MESH) algorithm is in operational use to diagnose the presence and size of hail. This study aims to use dual-Doppler observations as well as the MESH algorithm to test the idea that storms that rotate produce larger hail. Previous studies have used polarimetric radar products to detect the presence of large hail and dual-Doppler methods have been used to study embryonic hail, but no research has tested the theory of hail and rotating storms with observational evidence. A set of 59 case studies was gathered; each included a hail report submitted by a trained weather spotter or NWS employee and complete radar observations through the depth of a storm from two radars. The radar observations were resampled to a three-dimensional Cartesian grid and a dual-Doppler analysis was run on each case study. A strong correlation (stronger even than the MESH algorithm) was found between measured vorticity and hail size, lending credence to the idea that rotating storms do indeed have a higher ceiling for hail production. However, no correlation was found between MESH error and rotation. Further research will be required to evaluate whether or not this relationship can be used to augment the MESH algorithm so as to improve its skill.\",","14156":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14157":"\"description-provenance\": [","14158":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-04T09:00:39Z (GMT).

Harvest intervals of two weeks before maturity, at maturity, and 2 weeks after maturity resulted in significant differences in fruit quality and juice chemistry, but few of these differences persisted in cider chemistry. Nonetheless, differences in concentration of some individual polyphenols determined by UPLC-MS were observed in ciders made from fruit harvested at different stages.

York having 20% higher epicatechin concentration when stored for 6 weeks at 1\u00b0C rather than 10\u00b0C. Finally, the accuracy of the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) assay, commonly used for quantification of total polyphenols in fruit juices and fermented fruit beverages was critically evaluated.  Reducing sugars in the sample matrix did not affect the results of the FC assay, whereas the presence of the amino acid tyrosine resulted in significant overestimation of total polyphenols in fruit juice by the FC assay.\",","14199":"\"description-degree\": \"MSLFS\",","14200":"\"description-provenance\": [","14201":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-04T09:00:47Z (GMT).

The purpose of the analysis was to examine the ship from a naval architectural standpoint pertaining to hydrostatics, stability, weight and center of gravity, sea keeping, and basic resistance/powering requirements.  The overall objective was to see if the story of the CSS Virginia, destroyed on May 11th, 1862 by its own crew to keep it from falling into Union hands, could have ended differently with an attack on Washington, a northern city such as New York or Boston, or a run to a friendly Southern port such as Savannah or Charleston.    Paramarine software was used to build a geometry model based on lines included in a book by Sumner B. Besse for ship modelers.  The geometry model provided the basic measures of displacement for the hull form at a draft of 21 ft forward and 22 ft aft which in turn allowed for a weight estimate to be undertaken.  The goal of the weight estimate was to obtain, in particular, an estimate for the VCG of the vessel.  It also allowed for gyradius calculations based on the resultant weight distribution to be calculated.  Historical information coupled with the Paramarine geometry was used for the weight analysis.    Paramarine was used to obtain Random Amplitude Operators (RAOs) for a sea keeping analysis and long term effectiveness ratings considering MSI and Deck Wetness criteria were obtained based on statistical wave data from NOAA taken from stations in the Chesapeake Bay and in the Atlantic, 64 miles east of Virginia Beach.    A NAVCAD analysis was made for resistance requirements, though any resistance analysis of such an antiquated hull form that is also in its way unique has large uncertainties associated with it.    The results of the analysis shed some light on the CSS Virginia and its history.    The hydrostatic analysis leads one to speculate that draft reduction efforts made to allow the Virginia to escape Union capture by sailing up the James River were known to be hopeless, but undertaken anyway to save the honor of those involved and shift blame for the loss of the ship elsewhere.    The resistance and powering analysis suggests that an upper speed of 6 knots was probably not outside the CSS Virginia's capabilities.  Speeds much higher seem unlikely. The only way to know more would be to get better estimates of power provided by the ship's steam engines and do a tow tank test of a ship model.  Assuming a speed of 6 knots and based on a coal consumption rate, it was found that range of the CSS Virginia was at best around 614 nautical miles, giving it the distance to attack New York or sail to Charleston or Savannah.  However, the sea keeping analysis shows that the Virginia was very much at home on the relatively calm waters of the Chesapeake Bay, but would have run great risks in sailing on the open sea either to attack a Northern city or make a run to the South for safer waters to fight another day.  The officers of the Virginia felt that the ship was likely to flounder; based on the deck wetness criteria chosen for the sea keeping analysis their professional judgment was correct.  Details of the weight analysis and a full set of RAOs are provided in the Appendices.\",","14333":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14334":"\"description-provenance\": [","14335":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:00:22Z (GMT).

The challenge, however, is to reduce the size of the passive components in circuit boards (e.g., the inductors), which are typically the most bulky. There are two ways to approach this problem. The first is to redesign the flux in the inductor in order to minimize its size; the second is to optimize the magnetic properties of the constituent magnetic materials, which include permeability, density, resistivity, core loss density, saturation magnetization value, fluidity, sintering temperature, and others. Compared to altering the nature of solid magnetic materials to reduce space constraints, modifying the magnetic composite is preferred. The most popular candidates for use in magnetic composites are magnetic powders and polymer composites. In particular, when metal alloys are chosen as magnetic powders they have high initial permeability, high saturation magnetization values, but low electrical resistivity. Since polymers can serve as insulation materials, mixing metal alloys with polymers will increase electrical resistivity. The most common metal alloy used is nickel-iron (permalloy) and Metglas.  Since existing modeling methods are limited in (a) that multiphasic composites cannot be utilized and (b) the volume fraction of magnetic particles must be low, this investigation was designed to utilize FE (finite element) simulation to analyze how magnetic properties change with the distribution of permalloy powder or Metglas flakes in composites.  The primary magnetic properties of interest in this study are permeability and core loss density. Furthermore two kinds of magnetic composites were utilized in this investigationa benzocyclobutene (BCB) matrix-permalloy and a benzocyclobutene (BCB) matrix-permalloy-based amorphous alloy (Metglas 2705M) material. In our FE simulations, a BCB matrix-permalloy composite was utilized in a body-centered cubic model with half-diameter smaller particles serving as padding. The composite was placed in a uniform magnetic field surrounded by a material whose relative permeability was equal to zero in simulation. In comparison to experimental results, our model was able to predict permeability of composites with volume fraction higher than 52%. It must be noted, however, that although our model was able to predict permeability with only 10% off, it was less effective with respect to core loss density findings. The FE model also showed that permeability will increase with an increasing volume fraction of magnetic particles in the composite. To modify the properties of the composite material, the model of the BCB matrix-permalloy-Metglas composite followed model simulations up to the point at which flakes were inserted in BCB matrix-permalloy composite. The thickness of flakes was found to be an important factor in influencing resulting magnetic properties. Specifically, when the thickness of flakes decreased to quarter size at the same volume fraction, the permeability increased by 15%, while core loss density decreased to a quarter of the original value.  The analysis described herein of the important relationship between magnetic properties and the composites is expected to aid in the development and design of new magnetic composite materials.\",","14374":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14375":"\"description-provenance\": [","14376":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:00:37Z (GMT).

The development of the cities depended upon availability of resources for a better livelihood and the way humans utilize the resources. Even today as cities develop, people hope for better living conditions.  Urbanism plays a major role in the development of cities, being a combination of cultural and urban living. Urbanism has brought various downfalls along with progress. Has urbanism made development a monotonous concept?  These days, cities are urbanizing at a fast rate not considering their future consequences. Having lived in Mumbai, I have seen it grow into a megacity. The countless problems that urbanism has brought to accommodate the massive amount of people migrating into the city has affected the quality of life of people immensely. However, is it for the better or worse? People all over the country want to have a piece of Mumbai, the city of dreams. This growth in the population has overpowered the city.  Mumbai is famous for its railway system. It is the lifeline of the city. However, due to the amount of people using this system, the travel is more of a chaos. Every railway station has a main access road filled with hawkers and commercial storefronts. People in Mumbai are always in a rush, so these hawkers and commercial stores are a necessity to their daily life. People shop for their daily necessities while returning home to save time. However, these streets are extremely chaotic and crowded. My thesis focuses on how this space can be utilized by three consumers - the traveler, the shopper and the one who does both. It aims to decongest this main street and make travelling by local trains convenient. The site I have chosen is located in the heart of Mumbai city and is one of the most important railway station on the Western Suburban railway system. It is known as Dadar railway station.

The traffic information can be obtained from the presented approach includes vehicle counts, speed estimation and vehicle classification based on size. Two categories of sensors are used including IR Lidar and IR camera. With the two sensors, three detection techniques are usedTime of Flight (ToF) based, vision based and Laser spot flow based. Each technique outputs observations about vehicle location at different time step. By fusing the three observations in the framework of Kalman filter, vehicle location is estimated, based on which other concerned traffic information including vehicle counts, speed and class is obtained. In this process, high reliability is achieved by combing the strength of each techniques. To achieve self-powering, a dynamic power management strategy is developed to reduce system total energy cost and optimize power supply in traffic monitoring based on traffic pattern recognition. The power manager attempts to adjust the power supply by reconfiguring system setup according to its estimation about current traffic condition. A system prototype has been built and multiple field experiments and simulations were conducted to demonstrate traffic monitoring accuracy and power reduction efficacy.\",","14500":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14501":"\"description-provenance\": [","14502":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:01:02Z (GMT).

Also, there is no unique relationship between control inputs and the aircraft response. Distinct sets of control surface deflections may result in the same aircraft response, but with large differences in actuation power. An Artificial Neural Network and a Genetic Algorithm were used here for the control allocation optimization problem of a Hybrid Wing Body to minimize the Sum of Absolute Values of Hinge Moments for a 2.5-G pull-up maneuver. To test the versatility of the same optimization process for different aircraft configurations, the present work also investigates its application on the Forward Swept Wing aircraft. A method to improve the robustness of the process is also presented. Constraints on the load factor and longitudinal pitch rate were added to the optimization to preserve the trim constraints on the control deflections. Another method was developed using stability derivatives. This new method provided better results, and the computational time was reduced by two orders of magnitude. A hybrid scheme combining both methods was also developed to provide a real-time estimate of the optimum control deflection schedules to trim the airplane and minimize the actuation power for changing flight conditions (Mach number, altitude and load factor) in a pull-up maneuver. Finally, the stability derivatives method and the hybrid scheme were applied for an antisymmetric, steady roll maneuver.\",","14543":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14544":"\"description-provenance\": [","14545":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:01:08Z (GMT).

The rise of multidrug resistant pathogens threatens a return to the pre-antibiotic era where even the most common infections may be impossible to treat. It is estimated that the majority of global antibiotic use, and use in the U.S., is dedicated towards livestock, where they are used to promote growth, treat, or prevent disease. Given that exposure to antibiotics selects for antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) and can stimulate the horizontal transfer of their associated antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), it is important to examine livestock operations as a reservoir of resistance. Correspondingly, there is growing interest in identifying how agricultural practices can limit the potential for spread of antibiotic resistance through the \\"farm to fork continuum,\\" starting with antibiotic use practices, manure management and land application and ending with the spread of ARBs and ARGs present onto edible crops and serving as a route of exposure to consumers. This study focused specifically on the effect of composting on the prevalence of ARBs and ARGs in cattle manure. Three composting trials were performedsmall-scale, heat-controlled, and large-scale. The small-scale composting trial compared dairy and beef manures, with or without antibiotic treatment (treated beef cattle received chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and tylosin while treated dairy cattle received cephapirin and pirlimycin), subject to either static or turned composting. The heat-controlled composting trial examined only dairy manure, with or without antibiotic treatment, subject to static composting, but using external heat tape applied to the composting tumblers to extend the duration of the thermophilic (>55\u00b0C) temperature range. The large-scale composting trial examined dairy manure, with or without antibiotic treatment, subject to static composting at a much larger scale that is more realistic to typical farm practices. Samples were analyzed to assess phenotypic resistance using the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method and by diluting and plating onto antibiotic-supplemented agar. Genetic markers of resistance were also assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to quantify sul1 and tet(W) ARGs; metagenomic DNA sequencing and analysis were also performed to assess and compare total ARG abundance and types across all samples. Results indicate that composting can enrich indicators of phenotypic and genetic resistance traits to certain antibiotics, but that most ARGs are successfully attenuated during composting, as evidenced by the metagenomic sequencing. Maintaining thermophilic composting temperatures for adequate time is necessary for the effective elimination of enteric bacteria. This study suggests that indicator bacteria that survive composting tend to be more resistant than those in the original raw manure; however, extending the thermophilic stage of composting, as was done in the heat-controlled trial, can reduce target indicator bacteria below detection limits. Of the two ARGs specifically quantified via qPCR, prior administration of antibiotics to cattle only had a significant impact on tet(W). There was not an obvious difference in the final antibiotic resistance profiles in the finished beef versus dairy manure composts according to metagenomics analysis. Based on these results, composting is promising as a method of attenuating ARGs, but further research is necessary to examine in depth all of the complex interactions that occur during the composting process to maximize performance. If not applied appropriately, e.g., if time and temperature guidelines are not enforced, then there is potential that composting could exacerbate the spread of certain types of antibiotic resistance.\",","14589":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14590":"\"description-provenance\": [","14591":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:01:23Z (GMT).

The next chapter examines cognitive bias that government facility managers encounter using qualitative analysis. In this study, the research indicates facility managers encounter loss aversion, risk aversion, choice overload, and the status quo bias during energy decisions. The last chapter examines applications of choice architecture, specifically attribute framing, to emphasize the utility maximizing choice of long term energy reductions over initial cost. This study found that decision makers did not see the utility of the energy efficient option without an intervention to draw their attention to the long term savings. Once the decision makers became aware of the potential savings, they chose the most efficient (and utility maximizing) option.\",","14678":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14679":"\"description-provenance\": [","14680":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:01:43Z (GMT).

Based on Se concentrations in macroinvertebrates collected from 23 headwater streams, nine sites were selected for further studythree reference streams with no history of coal-mining, and six streams influenced by coal mining. Mining-influenced streams were further separated into high-Se and low-Sestreams based on macroinvertebrate tissue Se concentrations. Water-column, sediment, biofilm, leaf detritus, and prey and predator macroinvertebrates were collected and analyzed for Se concentration during two sample periods, Sept. - Oct. 2015 and Feb.-March 2016. Selenium concentrations in all media were found to be elevated in mining-influenced over reference streams and in high-Se over low-Se streams. Selenium dynamics, enrichment in particulate media (sediment, biofilm and leaf detritus) and trophic transfer of Se to prey from particulate media and to predators from prey, did not exhibit major differences among streams of differing Se levels. Water column Se concentrations were predicative of Se concentrations in macroinvertebrate tissues. Findings from this study indicate headwater streams influenced by coal-mining are capable of a high degree of Se bioaccumulation in macroinvertebrate populations.\",","14725":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14726":"\"description-provenance\": [","14727":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-07T09:01:50Z (GMT).

Therefore, the Michelson interferometer has significant potential as a tool for quantifying the degree of temporal coherence of a quasi-monochromatic light beam. Simulation of the performance of an optical instrument using the Monte-Carlo ray-trace (MCRT) method has been shown to be an efficient method for transferring knowledge of the coherence state of a beam of light from one instrument to another. The goal of the effort reported here is to create and experimentally validate an MCRT model for the optical performance of a Michelson interferometer. The effort is motivated by the need to consolidate the knowledge and skills of the investigator in the realm of physical optics, and by the need to make a useful analytical tool available to other investigators in the larger effort.\",","14769":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14770":"\"description-provenance\": [","14771":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-08T09:00:16Z (GMT).

The need for high temperature operation, combined with the need for real-time data logging has created a growing demand for robust, high temperature RF electronics. This thesis presents the design of an intermediate frequency (IF) variable gain amplifier (VGA) for downhole communications, which can operate up to an ambient temperature of 230 \u00b0C. The proposed VGA is designed using 0.25 \u03bcm GaN on SiC high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) technology. Measured results at 230 \u00b0C show that the VGA has a peak gain of 27dB at center frequency of 97.5 MHz, and a gain control range of 29.4 dB. At maximum gain, the input P1dB is -11.57 dBm at 230 \u00b0C (-3.63 dBm at 25 \u00b0C). Input return loss is below 19 dB, and output return loss is below 12 dB across the entire gain control range from 25 \u00b0C to 230 \u00b0C. The variation with temperature (25 \u00b0C to 230 \u00b0C) is 1 dB for maximum gain, and 4.7 dB for gain control range.

Despite the ability in producing complex, three-dimensional architectures, the state of art DLP AM systems is limited to a single homogenous photo-polymer and it requires a large volume of resin bath to begin with. Extensible Multi-material Stereolithography (EMSL) is a novel high-resolution projection stereolithography system capable of manufacturing hybrid 3D objects. This system provides new capabilities, allowing more flexible design criteria through the incorporation of multiple feedstock materials throughout the structure. With EMSL manufacturing ability, multi-material programmable negative Poissons ratio honeycomb reentrant structures are realized.   Researchers have been studying auxetic structures over decades, the mechanical property control of auxetic structure mainly relies on geometry design in previous studies. Now with the help of EMSL system, other design variables associated with auxetic structures, such as material properties of local structural members, are added into design process. The additional variables are then proved to have significant effects on the material properties of the auxetic structures. The ability to accurately manufacture multi-material digital design will not only allow for novel mechanical and material researches in laboratory, but also extend the additive manufacturing technology to numerous future applications with characteristics such as multiple electrical, electromechanical and biological properties.

State of art wide band gap device including silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) devices are characterized and compared, final selection is made based on comparison result. Mostly used high frequency high power DC/DC converter topology dual active bridge (DAB) is introduced and compared with novel CLLC resonant converter in terms of switching loss and conduction loss point of view. CLLC holds ZVS capability over all load range and smaller turn off current value. This is beneficial for high frequency operation and taken as our candidate. Device loss breakdown of CLLC converter is also given in the end. Medium voltage high frequency transformer is the key element in terms of insulation safety, power density and efficiency. Firstly, two mostly used transformer structures are compared. Then transformer insulation requirement is referred for 4160 V application according to IEEE standard. Solid insulation material are also compared and selected. Material thickness and insulation distance are also determined. Insulation capability is preliminary verified in FEA electric field simulation. Thirdly two transformer magnetic loss model are introduced including core loss model and litz wire winding loss model. Transformer turn number is determined based on core loss and winding loss trade-off. Different core loss density and working frequency impact is carefully analyzed. Different materials show their best performance among different frequency range. Transformer prototype is developed following designed parameter. We test the developed 15 kW 500 kHz transformer under 4160 V dry type transformer IEEE Std. C57.12.01 standard, including basic lightning test, applied voltage test, partial discharge test.  500 kHz 15 kW CLLC converter gate drive is our design challenge in terms of symmetry propagation delay, cross talk phenomenon elimination and shoot through protection. Gate drive IC is carefully selected to achieve symmetrical propagation delay and high common mode dv/dt immunity. Zero turn off resistor is achieved with minimized gate loop inductance to prevent cross talk phenomenon. Desaturation protection is also employed to provide shoot through protection.

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) took early action to promote sustainable designs in buildings and has become the most well-known rating system in the field of building sustainability. However, little research has evaluated the effects of LEED on occupant pro-environmental behavior. To examine this, a Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) was conducted in a traditional, green featured, and LEED certified building case to compare the similarities and differences in environmental awareness, perceptions, and perceived ease or difficulty of pro-environmental behaviors, as well as to assess the degree to which pro-environmental behaviors were exhibited by occupants.  This was used to determine if the aforementioned factors influence occupant behavior in different building cases. Ease or difficulty of pro-environmental behaviors and environmental awareness were found to be significant factors in influencing pro-environmental behavior in the LEED certified and green featured building cases. In addition, being in a LEED building appears to influence occupant pro-environmental behavior in a positive way. Also, there is evidence to suggest that being in a green featured building appears to influence occupants to exhibit pro-environmental behavior as well. These findings are valuable for owners and designers that want occupants in their buildings to exhibit pro-environmental behavior.\",","14948":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","14949":"\"description-provenance\": [","14950":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-09T09:00:36Z (GMT).

In this research, two multi-resonant shunt configurations, parallel and series, were proposed and optimized based on the H2 criteria when the base isolation system is subjected to ground acceleration excitations. The performance of the proposed multi-resonant electromagnetic shunt was compared with traditional multiple tuned mass dampers (TMDs) applied to the base isolation system. It shows that, for multiple TMDs and multi-resonant electromagnetic shunt dampers with 5% total stiffness ratio, the parallel shunt electromagnetic shunt can achieve the best vibration mitigation performance among other types of multi-resonant dampers, including parallel TMDs, series TMDs and the series electromagnetic shunt damper. Case study of a base-isolated structure was analyzed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-resonant electromagnetic shunt. It shows that both multi-mode shunt circuits outperform single mode shunt circuit by suppressing the primary and the second vibration modes simultaneously. Comparatively, the parallel shunt circuit is more effective in vibration mitigation and energy harvesting, and is also more robust in parameter mistuning than the series shunt circuit. The time history response analysis shows that, under the recorded Northridge earthquake, the instant peak power and total average power capable to be harvested by the multi-resonant shunt can reach up to 1.18 MW and 203.37KW, respectively.  This thesis further experimentally validated the effectiveness of the multi-resonant electromagnetic shunt on a scaled-down base-isolated building. The impact hammer test shows that the multi-resonant electromagnetic shunt can achieve enhanced vibration suppression by reducing the first resonant peak by 27.50dB and the second resonant peak by 22.57dB regarding the primary structure acceleration. The shake table test shows that under scaled Kobe and Northridge earthquake signals, the electromagnetic shunt can effectively reduce the vibration resonant peak value by 38.92% and 66.61%, respectively. The voltage simultaneously generated in the multi-mode shunt circuit was also obtained, which demonstrated the dual functions of the multi-resonant electromagnetic shunt in base isolation.\",","15036":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15037":"\"description-provenance\": [","15038":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-09T09:01:09Z (GMT).

Managing eutrophication is of utmost importance in Maine, USA due to the large number of inland fresh waterbodies and their economic importance for fisheries, recreation, and real estate. This thesis investigates the relationships between water quality and catchment land use. Agricultural land use is a large driver of excess nutrient export to lakes, including in Maine, and can result in toxic cyanobacterial blooms, decreased water clarity, and fish kills. I developed a statistical relationship to quantitatively link agricultural intensity in the catchment and resultant water quality outcomes in Maine lakes. I observe a strong statistical relationship between water quality and anthropogenic activity in the catchment, as expected. Interestingly, I found that the effects of anthropogenic activity were most closely related to a five-year lag in water quality, which is between 0.8 to 4.71 years longer than the lake residence times. My results suggest that changes in land use may have long-term effects on water quality that last for far longer than would be expected. The analysis presented in this paper is novel for directly linking long term observational agricultural and biological datasets and presents a new way to quantitatively link water quality and anthropogenic intensity in the catchment area.\",","15080":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15081":"\"description-provenance\": [","15082":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-09T18:27:52Z (GMT).

During a competition, the physical component crucially affects the final result of a match. In field sports such as soccer physical demand data are collected using the global positioning system (GPS).  There is question regarding the validity and reliability of using GPS technology for court sports such as tennis. The purpose of this study is to determine the validity and reliability of GPS to determine distances covered during simulated tennis movements. This was done by comparing GPS recorded distances to distances determined with a calibrated trundle wheel.  Two SPI HPU units were attached to the wheel Four different trials were performed to assess accuracy and reliabilitydistance trial (DIST), shuttle run trial (SHUT), change of direction trial (COD) and random movement trial (RAND). The latter three trials are performed on a tennis court and designed to mimic movements during a tennis match.  Bland-Altman analysis showed that during all trails, there were small differences in the trundle wheel and GPS derived distances.  Bias for the DIST, SHUT, COD and RAND trails were -0.02\u00b10.10, -0.51\u00b10.15, -0.24\u00b10.19 and 0.28\u00b10.20%, respectively.  Root mean squared (RMS) errors for the four trials were 0.41\u00b10.10, 1.28\u00b10.10, 1.70\u00b10.10 and 1.55\u00b10.13%.  Analysis of paired units showed a good reliability with mean bias and RMS errors <2%%.  These results suggest that SPI HPU units are both accurate and reliable for simulated tennis movements.   They can be confidently used to determine the physical demands of court sports like tennis.\",","15123":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15124":"\"description-provenance\": [","15125":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-09T18:27:59Z (GMT).

In response, automakers have been developing lane departure active safety systems to alert drivers to impending departures. These lane departure warning (LDW) and lane departure prevention (LDP) systems have great potential to reduce the frequency and mitigate the severity of serious lane and road departure crashes. The objective of this thesis was to characterize lane and road departures to better understand the effect of systems such as LDW and LDP on single vehicle road departure crashes. The research includes the following1) a characterization of lane departures through analysis of normal lane keeping behavior, 2) a characterization of road departure crashes through the development and validation of a real-world crash database of road departures (NCHRP 17-43 Lite), and 3) develop enhancements to the Virginia Tech LDW U.S. fleetwide benefits model. Normal lane keeping behavior was found to vary with road characteristics such as lane width and road curvature. Consideration of the dynamic driving behaviors observed in the naturalistic driving study (NDS) data is important to avoid LDW false alarms and driver annoyance. Departure characteristics computed in normal driving were much less severe than the departure parameters measured in real-world road departure crashes.  The real-world crash data collected in NCHRP 17-43 Lite database was essential in developing enhancements to the existing Virginia Tech LDW fleetwide benefits model. Replacement of regression model predictions with measured crash data and improvement of the injury criteria resulted in an 11-16% effectiveness for road departure crashes, and an 11-15% reduction in seriously injured drivers.\",","15165":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15166":"\"description-provenance\": [","15167":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-09T18:28:07Z (GMT).

We consider the setting in which there exists correlations between node  failures in networks, which has been studied in the case of many  infrastructure networks. We formalize the prob{} problem using the Minimum  Description Length (MDL) principle and we show that, in general, finding  solutions that minimize the MDL cost is hard, and develop efficient algorithms  with rigorous performance guarantees for finding near-optimal MDL cost  solutions. We evaluate our methods on both synthetic and real world datasets,  which includes the one from WAZE. WAZE is a crowd-sourced road navigation  tool, that collects and presents the traffic incident reports. We found that  the proposed greedy algorithm for this problem is able to recover $80%$, on  average, of the failed nodes in a network for a given partial sample of input  failures, which are sampled from the true set of failures at some predefined  rate. Furthermore, we have also proved that this algorithm will find a  solution that has MDL cost with an additive approximation guarantee of $log(n)$  from the optimal.\",","15249":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15250":"\"description-provenance\": [","15251":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-09T18:28:26Z (GMT).

There are three main parts to the proposed system. The first part is data collection and data fusion using embedded hardware, the second part is data processing (segmentation) and the third part is creating a geometry mesh of the environment.

These civilizations developed along rivers as riverfronts provided opportunities for tradeand transportation, fertile land to grow crops, water for drinking, washing, livestock and other domestic uses and food in the form of fish. Gradually, they came to define cities, became a part of identities of people, such as \\"India\\" from \\"Indus,\\" while, providing a sense of place and connecting the populace to nature. Yet rivers have often ended up being abused and neglected in our course towards urbanization. It is this \\"neglect\\" that needs to be shunned. The relationship with the rivers needs to be re-forged. To develop a strategy for this shift in attitude, this research has chosen the case of Chesapeake Bay.    Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean. It has mainland North America to its west and Delmarva Peninsula on the east. It is the largest Estuary in the United States. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the Chesapeake Bay. The estuary provides habitat to several species of wildlife and aquatic life.   Today, this bay faces many issues such as nutrient and sediment pollution, Storm water runoff, lowering of shellfish species etc.   One of the major causes of the polluted bay is storm water runoff. Storm water washes pollution off the roads and other surfaces and takes them to the water. Stormwater is generally more polluted in urban areas than rural areas.    This thesis, attempts to demonstrate what can be done with a typical pixel in the whole mosaic of the bay . The Maine Avenue Fish Market, sitting just upstream to the now being developed Southwest Waterfront, seems a perfect choice for this endeavor. This market, a small urban waterfront space, is ideal for exploring  ideas and solutions to avoid water pollution by stormwater, cleaning the quality of water and also, in the process, develop the area in relation to the city and its surroundings.    This thesis aims to establish an ecological and social relationship between the natural resource and  the urban life.\",","15334":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15335":"\"description-provenance\": [","15336":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-10T09:00:13Z (GMT).

Microbial pathogens may attach and form biofilms on raw fruit surfaces and can be difficult to remove. A cavitation process (formation of bubbles in water) was studied for its effectiveness for removal and inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Newport from the surfaces of fresh Roma tomatoes and cantaloupes. Individual fruit were separately inoculated with each pathogen, then submerged in a water tank and treated with a bubble flow through an air stone using one airflow rate (0 \ufffd\\" 14 liters/min.) for up to 60 sec.  As air flow increased, pathogen reduction increased up to 1.2 log CFU/fruit greater than with water alone (no bubbles).  Additional pathogen reduction in the tank water (organisms detached from the fruit) was observed with the bubble treatments.  Therefore, these bubble streams can be used to enhance the detachment of bacteria from fruit surfaces and to inactivate a proportion of these detached microorganisms.   Additionally, recoveries of Salmonella from inoculated Roma tomatoes and cantaloupe were determined for treatment water that contained 50 or 150 ppm sodium   hypochlorite.  The combination of cavitation and chlorine resulted in greater efficacy of inactivating the pathogen in treatment water, but not in removing this organism from the fruit surfaces.  The physical force of a bubble stream on raw produce can effectively reduce and inactivate surface bacteria, and has the potential to reduce antimicrobial chemical and water use in post-harvest packing operations.\",","15377":"\"description-degree\": \"MSLFS\",","15378":"\"description-provenance\": [","15379":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-11T09:00:23Z (GMT).

While research into plant genetics has seen an increased throughput from recent technological advancements, plant phenotypic research throughput has lagged behind. Improvements in open-source image processing software and image capture hardware have created an opportunity for the development of more competitively-priced, faster data-acquisition tools. These tools could be used to collect measurements of plants' phenotype on a much larger scale without sacrificing data quality. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of creating such a tool.   The resulting design utilized stereo vision and image processes in the OpenCV project to measure a representative collection of observable plant traits like leaflet length or plant height. After the stereo camera was assembled and calibrated, visual and stereo images of potato plant canopies and tubers(potatoes) were collected. By processing the visual data, the meaningful regions of the image (the canopy, the leaflets, and the tubers) were identified. The same regions in the stereo images were used to determine plant physical geometry, from which the desired plant measurements were extracted.  Using this approach, the tool had an average accuracy of 0.15 inches with respect to distance measurements. Additionally, the tool detected vegetation, tubers, and leaves with average Dice indices of 0.98, 0.84, and 0.75 respectively. To compare the tool's utility to that of traditional implements, a study was conducted on a population of 27 potato plants belonging to 9 separate genotypes. Both newly developed and traditional measurement techniques were used to collect measurements of a variety of the plants' characteristics. A multiple linear regression of the plant characteristics on the plants' genetic data showed that the measurements collected by hand were generally better correlated with genetic characteristics than those collected using the developed tool; the average adjusted coefficient of determination for hand-measurements was 0.77, while that of the tool-measurements was 0.66. Though the aggregation of this platform's results is unsatisfactory, this work has demonstrated that such an alternative to traditional data-collection tools is certainly attainable.\",","15423":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15424":"\"description-provenance\": [","15425":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-14T09:00:43Z (GMT).

Due to the recent developments in concrete and steel technology, the usage of high strength materials in these concrete filled tubes is increasing. The governing American specification (AISC 360-16) classifies these composite members as compact, non-compact and slender sections. The allowed section slenderness (ratio of diameter to thickness ratio) in each classification is related to the material properties (ratio of Young's modulus to yield strength ratio). AISC 360-16 is applicable for steels up to 75 ksi and concretes up to 10 ksi.  These limits are lower than current available materials and restricts the usage of highly slender sections. As the strength of these tubes is dependent on local buckling, tests on many combinations of high strength steel and concrete are needed to extend these material limits.  This preliminary research work focuses on understanding the local buckling behavior of highly slender sections and the effect of concrete infill and its confinement.  The research began by compiling a database that highlighted a gap on tests with highly slender sections and high strength materials. To address this issue, a pilot set of experimental tests were conducted on short circular concrete filled members. An analytical evaluation of these experimental results are performed using 3D finite element analysis models. The critical buckling load is determined using J2 deformation theory, which proves to give a good estimate when compared with the experimental results. The main objective of the work is to determine if a simplified test like the one used in this work could be used for the large experimental study that will be necessary to expend the material limits in AISC 360-16. The limited data developed in this study indicates that the test can provide satisfactory results with a few improvements and refinements.\",","15465":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15466":"\"description-provenance\": [","15467":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-15T09:00:17Z (GMT).

When providing information to patients with low health literacy, teach-back (TB) and teach-to-goal (TTG) methods are recommended, but no studies have examined the degree to which TB/TTG strategies can be implemented with fidelity in community-based programs. A study was conducted to determine if type of delivery staff (community or research) is related to implementation fidelity; the degree to which TB/TTG methods are necessary for parent/caregiver understanding of childhood obesity learning objectives; and if baseline parent/caregiver health literacy level is related to support call response. Ninety-four families with overweight/obese children aged 8-12 years were enrolled in a pilot childhood obesity intervention that included 6 bi-weekly parent/caregiver support calls integrating TB/TTG methods into a 5 A's approach. Research partners (n=2) delivered all calls in Wave 1. During Waves 2 and 3, community staff (n=5) delivered a majority of calls with training and support from research staff. ). Average completion rate across calls was 62% and did not differ according to participant health literacy level. Community partners were more likely than research partners to complete calls with participants (68% versus 57%), but this trend was not significant. Both research and community partners adhered to call scripts with high fidelity (97% versus 98%). A significant main effect of health literacy level on TB/TTG performance was found for Call 1 and Call 3 during Wave 1 and for Call 1 during Waves 2 and 3 of iChoose (p<0.05, 0.01, and 0.05). An interaction effect of health literacy level and question number was found for Call 3 during Wave 1 only (p<0.05). For all calls in which TB/TTG performance differed significantly by health literacy level, participants with adequate health literacy were found to have better performance. Following the program, participants expressed they felt satisfied and comfortable with follow-up calls (9.1 (2.0) and 9.5 (1.2) on a 10-point scale), while agreeing that calls helped improve their eating and PA habits (8.1 (2.6) and 7.5 (2.7)) and helped them learn class material better (8.1 (2.7)). Trained community partners were able to deliver the same support call content with similarly high fidelity, completion, and acceptability. Although participant baseline health literacy level had less impact on the need for TB/TTG and on program perception than we anticipated, our findings open up different possibilities to utilize these strategies while using precious resources more efficiently.\",","15509":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15510":"\"description-provenance\": [","15511":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-16T09:00:14Z (GMT).

While many solutions to reducing the risk of mine disasters have been proposed, including stricter regulation and improved technology, a comprehensive risk management approach has yet to be fully integrated in the U.S. mining industry.  Comprehensive risk management systems have been developed and implemented across a multitude of heavy industries, most notably the Australian minerals industry. This research examines the successful application of risk management in these industries, along with barriers towards U.S. implementation of risk management, which include the existence of competing safety models (e.g. behavior-based safety) and compliance regulation which consumes company resources, and limits incentive for beyond compliance safety measures. Steps towards the risk-based approach, including increased regulatory pressure and proactive initiation by high-ranking industry individuals, begin with the development of risk-based knowledge within the U.S. mining community.  This research reviews the development of mine safety regulation in the U.S., and identifies regulatory constraints which have affected the diffusion of risk management. The development of a risk-based online platform which could complement the existing safety systems of U.S. underground coal operations, based on the Australian RISKGATE tool, is the central work of this research. This online platform has been developed by the research participants and industry professionals whose total underground coal mining experience exceeds 1,290 years. This joint effort has yielded a body-of-knowledge which may be used as a complementary safety control reference for U.S. mine operators who wish to employ risk management policies and practices at their own operations, or identify gaps within their own safety control systems.\",","15552":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15553":"\"description-provenance\": [","15554":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-17T09:00:35Z (GMT).

The environmental persistence of veterinary antibiotics applied to agricultural fields during manure fertilization could lead to increased antibiotic resistance. New generation, neonicotinoid pesticides pose a threat to aquatic ecosystem health due high water mobility and increased potential for non-target exposure. The objectives of this research were to develop a sensitive, analytical method for quantification of pirlimycin (PLY) in soils to be used in field research and determine the ability of second-generation neonicotinoids to move through soil when applied as a seed coating using a greenhouse study. Liquid-solid extraction of PLY from soil using (1:6, v/v) ammonium hydroxide/methylene chloride produced good PLY recovery (67-140%). Liquid-chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry for instrumental analysis provided good sensitivity with minimal matrix interferences. The mass balance distribution of neonicotinoid treatment coated onto corn seeds was determined in plant and soil samples for a single pot after 3 weeks of growth. A large percent (83-87%) of initial pesticide coating applied to seed was un-detected in plant in soil. Of the detected portion of neonicotinoid treatment, between 96-98% was observed to move out into the soil. This suggests the potential for long-range transport of seed-coated neonicotinoids.\",","15639":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15640":"\"description-provenance\": [","15641":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-21T09:00:35Z (GMT).

One of the important design challenges in MMC is to reduce the capacitor size. In the current practice, a rather large capacitor bank is required to store line-frequency related circulating energy, even though a number of control strategies have been introduced to reduce the capacitor voltage ripples. In the present paper, a novel control strategy is proposed by means of harmonic injections in conjunction with gain control to completely eliminate both the line frequency and the second-order harmonic of the capacitor voltage ripple. Ideally, the proposed method works with the full bridge topology. However, the concept also works with half bridge topology with a significant reduction of line frequency related ripple. To gain a better understanding of the nature of circulating energy and the means of reducing it, the method of state plane analysis is employed to offer visual support. In addition, the design trade-off between full bridge MMC and half bridge MMC is presented and a novel control strategy for a hybrid MMC is proposed. Finally, the work is supported with a scaled down hardware demonstration.\",","15682":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15683":"\"description-provenance\": [","15684":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-21T09:00:42Z (GMT).

The goal of this work was to investigate turbulent flames with extremely high turbulence intensity using a recently developed HiPilot burner (a Bunsen-type burner). The studies were first conducted on a series of piloted jet flames to validate the methodology, and then conducted on the highly turbulent flames generated by the HiPilot burner. All flames were controlled by combusting methane and air under a fuel to air equivalence ratio of \ufffd*=1.05, and the Reynolds number varied from 7,385 to 28,360. Flame surface density fields and profiles for the HiPilot burner are presented. These flame surface density measurements showed an overall decrease with height above the burner. In addition, curvature statistics for the HiPilot flames were calculated and probability density functions of the curvature samples were determined. The probability density functions of curvature for the flames showed Gaussian-shaped distributions centered near zero curvature. To conclude, flame topography measurements were verified on jet flames and were demonstrated on the new HiPilot flames.\",","15727":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15728":"\"description-provenance\": [","15729":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-22T09:00:20Z (GMT).

The purpose of this study is to investigate biophysical and climatic correlates of Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) insect outbreaks in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem (CCE) from 1962 to 2014 using Aerial Detection Survey (ADS) and climate data. Specific objectives were1) to develop statistical models to determine how selected biophysical correlates (slope, aspect, elevation, and latitude) and 2) to understand how local and global climate variables relate to the extent of the MPB infestations in the CCE, and 3) to contextualize the results of the models with historical climate data.  Overall, the major findings of this study are1) despite its limitations, the ADS data seems suitable for analysis of beetle damage with respect to climate and topographic factors, on a regional scale, 2) there appears to be a link between local biophysical factors and winter precipitation and TPA within the CCE, and 3) a combination of a negative-phase PDO and La Ni\u00f1a is important in forecasting a decline in MPB spread, during a given year. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to explore spatio-temporal patterns of MPB outbreaks using biophysical factors, and both local and global climate variables, over a fifty-year timespan in the CCE. In the future, additional geospatial analyses may enable a landscape assessment of factors contributing to variability of MPB infestation and damage as this insect continues to spread.\",","15770":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","15771":"\"description-provenance\": [","15772":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-02-23T09:00:20Z (GMT).

Are there key factors that influence different migrant incorporation strategies?  How do these factors influence the ways that Brazilian-Nikkeijin might be viewed in each city? This thesis explores the ways that local organizations in Toyota and Yokkaichi assist their Brazilian Nikkeijin migrant populations and the factors that influence these strategies.  I hypothesize that the domination of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Toyota and Yokkaichi's history of citizen mobilization significantly affect the ways in which these two cities approach migrant incorporation.  I also hypothesize that trends in the types of consultation sought by Brazilian Nikkeijin in the two cities will share seasonal patterns. I test these hypotheses through interviews conducted in 2015 with representatives from local organizations in Toyota and Yokkaichi and through the information in the websites of these organizations.  My findings support the hypotheses that the dominance of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Toyota and the unique characteristics of Yokkaichi's citizens, grounded in citizen mobilization experiences, influences the different approaches each city takes in responding to Brazilian needs.  However, they do not indicate visible seasonal patterns on the types of consultation services sought by Nikkeijin.  Previous literature frames the challenges Nikkeijin face in Japanese society and how local governments respond to those challenges in the larger picture of ethnicity and ethnically-based state policies.  The thesis contributes to discussions of return migration policies aimed at the integration of foreign residents and the patterns of ethnic negotiation and re-negotiation by co-ethnics when faced with problems as a result of unfulfilled cultural expectations.\",","15858":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","15859":"\"description-provenance\": [","15860":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-02T09:00:36Z (GMT).

Research factors included root manipulation, under-trellis ground cover, and rootstock.  Treatment levels were root bag (RBG) or no root manipulation (NRM); under-trellis cover crop (CC) or herbicide strip (HERB); and one of three rootstocks101-14, Riparia Gloire, or 420-A.  Effects of these treatments were measured in two experimentsExperiment I compared combinations of all three treatments, while Experiment II explored the individual effects of root restriction using root bags of varying volumes.  Root restriction consistently demonstrated the ability to reduce vegetative growth and vine water status.  In the first experiment fruit-zone photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was increased by 234% in RBG vines.  Timed canopy management tasks indicated that RBG canopies required about half the labor time of NRM canopies.  Anthocyanin concentration and total phenolic content were increased by 20% and 19% respectively in RBG fruit.  CC increased fruit-zone PPFD by 62%, and increased soluble solids and color compounds.

In this paper I develop an exemplarist theory of practical moral justification; that is, a theory of the justification of the prima facie moral things that we do, not the moral beliefs that we have. I take as my starting point that morality is, essentially, a set of practices in which all persons, in virtue of their being persons, participate. I argue that skillful practitioners of these various practices should be understood as moral authorities, and that the appeal to a moral authority for the purpose of one's justifying one's moral doings is necessarily justified for the appealer whenever she is practicing the same practice as the moral authority. This theory holds that moral authorities, so circumscribed, are Authoritative Exemplars, and as the appeal to their authority is necessarily justified they are able to provide a foundation for practical moral justifications, and thus rebutting the objection that all such justifications will run to regress. Among other things this account allows us to interpret the \\"Why be moral?\\" question as a question asking for more than can be had posed from a position of misunderstanding the nature of morality and practical moral justification. We cannot answer the \\"Why be moral?\\" question any more than we can answer the \\"Why be human?\\" question.\",","15960":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","15961":"\"description-provenance\": [","15962":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-03T09:00:39Z (GMT).

The main goal of this thesis is to study the driver behavior and analyze safety of drivers for different left turn indications using a real-time driving simulator. Different signal indications alter driver behavior which influences velocity and acceleration profiles. These profiles influence vehicular emissions and hence need to be studied as well. For this purpose, different scenarios are implemented in the driving simulator.  Data is analyzed using Microsoft Excel, JMP Statistical tool and MATLAB. Safety of drivers is analyzed with respect to the parameter \\"Time to Collision (TTC)\\" which is directly obtained from simulator data. Vehicular emissions and fuel consumption are calculated using VT-Micro microscopic emissions model. Graphs are plotted for TTC and total emissions. Results indicate that for a day-time scenario, FCY and FYA are the most suitable left-turning indications whereas FCR and FRA are most suitable for a night-time scenario.\",","16002":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16003":"\"description-provenance\": [","16004":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-04T09:00:17Z (GMT).

This approach allows tasks with an operational scope outside the range of the robot's manipulator to be completed without having to recalibrate the position of the end-effector each time the robot's mobile base moves to another position. This is achieved by localizing the AIMM within its area of operation (AO) using adaptive Monte Carlo localization (AMCL), which relies on the fused odometry and sensor messages published by the robot, as well as a 2-D map of the AO, which is generated using an optimization-based smoothing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technique. The robot navigates to a predefined start location in the map incorporating obstacle avoidance through the use of a technique called trajectory rollout. Once there, the robot uses its RGB-D sensor to localize an augmented reality (AR) tag in the map frame. Once localized, the identity and the 3-D position and orientation, collectively known as pose, of the tag are used to generate a list of initial feature points and their locations based on a priori knowledge. After the end-effector moves to the approximate location of a feature point provided by the AR tag localization, the feature point's location, as well as the end-effector's pose are refined to within a user specified tolerance through the use of a control loop, which utilizes images from a calibrated machine vision camera and a laser pointer, simulating stereo vision, to localize the feature point in 3-D space using computer vision techniques and basic geometry. This approach was implemented on two different ROS enabled robots, the Clearpath Robotics' Husky and the Fetch Robotics' Fetch, in order to show the utility of the multistage localization approach in executing two tasks which are prevalent in both manufacturing and constructiondrilling and sealant application. The proposed approach was able to achieve an average accuracy of \u00b1 1 mm in these operations, verifying its efficacy for tasks which have a larger operational scope than that of the range of the AIMM's manipulator and its robustness to general applications in manufacturing.\",","16052":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16053":"\"description-provenance\": [","16054":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-04T09:00:32Z (GMT).

With the increase in the design size, the associated testing effort to verify these designs is also increased. The goal of this thesis is to leverage some of the static analysis techniques to reduce the effort of testing and verification at the register transfer level. Studying a design at register transfer level gives exposure to the relational information for the design which is inaccessible at the structural level.  In this thesis, we present a way to generate a Data Dependency Graph and a Control Flow Graph out of a register transfer level description of a circuit description. Next, the generated graphs are used to perform relation mining to improve the test generation process in terms of speed, branch coverage and number of test vectors generated. The generated control flow graph gives valuable information about the flow of information through the circuit design. We are using this information to create a framework to improve the branch reachability analysis mainly in terms of the speed. We show the efficiency of our methods by running them through a suite of ITC'99 benchmark circuits.\",","16097":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16098":"\"description-provenance\": [","16099":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-07T09:00:12Z (GMT).

The need of the new research and development for advance electronics with high performances is the priority. The data transfer rates are improved for faster communication and better efficiency is to reduce the battery consumption in handheld devices.  This thesis presents three single-stage power amplifiers (PAs)class-AB, class-F and inverse class-F (class-F-1) at 28 GHz. The PAs have identical input networksinput matching, base DC feed, and base stabilizing networks. At the load side, there is a different load network for each PA. Class-AB PA load network has a single inductor with a parasitic capacitor to create a resonance at 28GHz. Class-F PA load network is composed of a parallel network (one LC tank in series with an inductor) and a series network (one 3f0-resonance LC tank in series with a capacitor) to create a multi-resonance load network. Class-F-1 load network is composed of a parallel network (two LC tank in series with an inductor) and a series network (one 2f0-resonance LC tank in series with a capacitor) to have a multi-resonance network. The main purpose of using multi-resonance load networks in class-F and class-F-1 is to shape the collector currents and voltages in order to achieve the highest efficiency possible.  The chosen bias point is VCE=2.3V and ICE~12mA. As the results, class-AB PA achieves the peak PAE of 44%, 15 dBm OP-1dB, >19 dBm Psat , and 10 dB Gp. Class-F PA achieves the peak PAE of 46%, 14.5 dBm OP-1dB, ~18 dBm Psat , and 10 dB Gp. Class-F-1 PA achieves the peak PAE of 45%, 15.1 dBm OP-1dB, >18 dBm Psat , and 10 dB Gp.. In order to compare the linearity performances among three PA classes, a two-tone signal and a modulated signal with different modulation schemes (QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and 256QAM) are applied to the PAs to produce IM3, ACPR, and EVM.  After the analysis and comparison on efficiency and linearity, class-F PA gives the highest efficiency but has the worst linearity while class-AB has the best linearity but has the worst efficiency among three. Class-F-1 PA results lies in the middle of two other classes in term of efficiency and linearity.\",","16140":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16141":"\"description-provenance\": [","16142":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-08T09:00:11Z (GMT).

The objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of using digested biosolids from a regional wastewater treatment plant as an ingredient in creating a biodegradable transplant biocontainer. The biosolids were tested for metals limits as specified by the U.S. EPA Part 503 Rule, and met the requirements for Class B. Multiple mixes of biosolids, fibers, starch, polymer, and natural glue were developed to provide overall pot stability and structural strength. Engineering tests, such as tensile strength, pH, and saturated paste tests, were conducted on the different mixes to determine the optimum strength that could be produced.  The top-performing biosolids mixes were used to make 10.2 cm (four-inch) pots that were compared in various ways to the market leaders, Peat Pots and standard plastic pots. A two-part mold was created on a 3D printer, which would allow for positive pressure to be used in forming the BioPots. Mixes were transferred to the lower half of the mold, the upper part was then plunged and fastened into the lower half, and then the mold with its mix was placed in an oven to dry. Laboratory germination bioassays were performed to test for the presence of phytotoxic compounds. Construction of BioPots for the lab-scale studies was tedious. Different methods (e.g., negative pressure systems) need to be investigated for use in producing the BioPots commercially.  Most of the BioPots survived the resiliency study. Leachate quality from the biocontainers was no worse than from the plastic containers. Some discoloration was observed on the biocontainers, but it was not due to algal/fungal growth. Growth of soybeans, marigolds, and romaine in the biocontainers was significantly better (e.g., increased height, leaf sizes, and weight) than in the plastic containers.\",","16187":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16188":"\"description-provenance\": [","16189":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-09T09:00:13Z (GMT).

Collision damage to bridges can range from minor to catastrophic, potentially requiring repair or replacement of a bridge girder.  This thesis investigates the performance of two different types of repair methods for flexural applicationsstrand splice repair, which is a traditional repair method that is often utilized, and fabric-reinforced cementitious matrix repair, which is a relatively new repair method.  The overarching goal of this project was to provide guidance for assessment and potential repair of impact-damaged girders.   Prestressed concrete girders were tested to failure in flexure in this research.  After a control test to establish a baseline for comparison, five tests were performed involving damaging a girder, repairing it using one of the repair methods, and testing it to failure.  These tests showed that both strand splice repairs and fabric-reinforced cementitious matrix repairs can adequately restore the strength of an impact-damaged girder when up to 10% of the prestressing strands are severed.  Combined repairs can also be a viable option if more than 10% of the prestressing strands are severed, though as the damage gets more severe, girder replacement becomes a more attractive option.\",","16232":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16233":"\"description-provenance\": [","16234":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-14T08:00:24Z (GMT).

One critical generation mechanism of tire-pavement interaction noise is tire tread excitation. The tire tread contributes to the tire-pavement interaction noise mainly through two mechanisms(1) tread block impact, and (2) the compression and expansion of the air in the tread groove at the contact patch. The tread pattern is the critical part of the tire design since it can be easily modified. Hence, the main focus of this study is to quantify the tread pattern contribution in total tire-pavement interaction noise. To achieve this goal, the noise produced by the tread pattern is separated from the total tire-pavement interaction noise. Since the tread pattern excitation is periodic with tire rotation, the noise produced by the tread is assumed to be related to the tire rotation. Hence, the order domain synchronous averaging method is used in this study to separate and quantify the tread pattern contribution to the total tire-pavement interaction noise. The experiment has been carried out using an On-Board-Sound-Intensity (OBSI) system. Five tires were tested including the Standard Reference Test Tire (SRTT). Compared to the conventional OBSI system, an optical sensor was added to the system to monitor the tire rotation. The once per revolution signal provided by the optical sensor is used to identify the noise signals associate to each revolution.  In addition to the averaging method using optical signals, other data processing techniques have been investigated for separating the tread-pattern noise without utilizing the once per revolution signal. These techniques are autocorrelation analysis, a frequency domain filter, principal component analysis, and independent component analysis.      In the tread-pattern noise generation, the tread profile is the most important input parameter. To characterize the tread profile, the tread pattern spectral content and air volume velocity spectral content for all the five tires are computed. Then, the tread pattern spectrum and the air volume velocity spectrum are both correlated with the separated tread-pattern noise by visual inspection of the spectra shape.\",","16276":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16277":"\"description-provenance\": [","16278":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-14T08:00:32Z (GMT).

Frequent changes in requirements reduce the reusability of the manually written test cases costing more time and effort. Most projects in the industry follow a Behavior-Driven software development approach to capturing requirements from the business stakeholders through user stories written in natural language. Instead of writing test cases manually, this thesis investigates a practical solution for automatically generating test cases within an Agile software development workflow using natural language-based user stories and acceptance criteria. However, the information provided by the user story is insufficient to create test cases using natural language processing (NLP), so we have introduced two new input parameters, Test Scenario Description and Dictionary, to improve the test case generation process. To establish the feasibility, we developed a tool that uses NLP techniques to generate functional test cases from the free-form test scenario description automatically. The tool reduces the effort required to create the test cases while improving the test coverage and quality of the test suite. Results from the feasibility study are presented in this thesis.\",","16362":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16363":"\"description-provenance\": [","16364":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-25T08:00:26Z (GMT).

In many markets, nuclear power faces strong headwinds due to competition with other fuel sources and prohibitively high capital costs. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), such as the proposed Advanced Fast Reactor (AFR) 100, have gained popularity in recent years as they promise economies of scale, reduced capital costs, and flexibility of deployment. Fast sodium reactors commonly feature an upper plenum with a large inventory of sodium. When temperatures change due to transients, stratification can occur. It is important to understand the stratification behavior of these large volumes because stratification can counteract natural circulation and fatigue materials.  This work features steady-state and transient simulations of thermal stratification and natural circulation of liquid sodium in a simple rectangular slice using a commercial CFD code (ANSYS FLUENT). Different inlet velocities and their effect on stratification are investigated by changing the inlet geometry. Stratification was observed in the two cases with the lowest inlet velocities. An approach for tracking the stratification interface was developed that focuses on temperature gradients rather than differences. Other authors have developed correlations to predict stratification in three dimensional enclosures. However, these correlations predict stratified conditions for all simulations even the ones that did not stratify. The previous models are modified to reflect the two-dimensional nature of the flow in the enclosure. The results align more closely with the simulations and correctly predict stratification in the investigated cases.\",","16449":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16450":"\"description-provenance\": [","16451":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-29T08:00:29Z (GMT).

Therefore, all the actors of economic and social development have a common concern and share in promoting rural agriculture (Bernard et al., 2008). Changes observed in the agricultural and rural sector reflect the will of the actors to have a productive, competitive, and sustainable agriculture system in order to ensure food security (International Monetary Fund, 2011). The purpose of the study is to develop a set of recommendations to improve the educational program planning and teaching skills of educators in the extension system by focusing on extension educators' approaches to teaching farmers and cart owners animal welfare practices for proper care of working animals. The extension agents and teachers involved in the animal husbandry and animal extension system in Thies and Bambey served as participants in this study. The methodology used for this descriptive qualitative study were interviews, qualitative document analysis, observations of an educational and professional development program planning for state agents and university faculty members in Diourbel and Thies regions, as well as a final focus group to allow participants clarification of preliminary themes found in the data. The data collected from participants were connected to the different used qualitative methods to gather data. The 11 themes found in this study were the characteristics of the participants, job expectation and responsibilities, institutional and organizational factors, capacity building and professional development plans, diagnostics of the extension system, regulations and legislations, limited sources of information, limited knowledge and skills technologies, recommendations for utilizing student-centered teaching practices, standard welfare for animal husbandry, recommendation for acceptance and improvement standard animal welfare related to the four research questions which addressed the topics of challenging current teaching methods used in the extension system for other owners of  animal species in the animal extension programs, the use of student-centered teaching practices in extension education and university instruction, and the level assistance given to farmers in order to ensure accepted standards of animal welfare working animal and other animal species in the animal husbandry system.</p>\",","16492":"\"description-degree\": \"MSLFS\",","16493":"\"description-provenance\": [","16494":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-29T08:00:37Z (GMT).

A Time-Resolved Doppler Global Velocimetry (TR-DGV) Instrument was applied to the Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR) at NASA's Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Lab (AAPL) to measure convection velocity. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements provided mean velocity and turbulence intensity. Eddy convection velocity results were obtained from the TR-DGV data for three-stream nozzle configurations using a cross-correlation approach. The three-stream cases included an axisymmetric and an asymmetric nozzle configuration. Results of the VT TR-DGV convection velocity were compared to NASA PIV mean and turbulence intensity data. For the axisymmetric case, areas of high convection velocity and turbulence intensity were found to be from 4 to 6 diameters downstream. Comparison of convection velocity between the axisymmetric and offset case show this same region as the greatest reduction in convection velocity due to the offset. These findings suggest this region along the centerline near the end of the potential core is an important area for noise generation with jets and contribute to the noise reductions seen from three stream offset nozzles. An analysis of a one-dimensional wavepacket model was completed to provide understanding of the effect of the various convection velocities seen in the flow. Comparison of a wavepacket with a convection velocity of 0.6Uj to a wavepacket with a convection velocity of 0.8Uj showed that an increase in convection velocity shifts the wavenumber spectrum to higher wavenumbers as expected. It was also observed that for the higher convection velocity wavepacket, higher frequencies are more acoustically efficient, while mid frequencies are the most efficient radiators in the lower convection velocity case. Using mean velocity, turbulence intensity, and convection velocity areas of likely to generate noise are identified and possible fundamental mechanisms responsible for the noise generation are discussed.\",","16541":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16542":"\"description-provenance\": [","16543":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-03-29T08:00:43Z (GMT).

In higher educational institutions, students work very closely with their academic advisors to solve a definite problem. Dependence on the academic advisor is much more when the advisee is international. Keeping these points in mind, one of the factors that might impact academic environment for an international student is the bonding that they share with their advisor. This research study determines the factors that encourage or discourage the relationship between the advisor and international advisee. More specifically, what factors, cultural or cognitive are more salient in defining the advising relationship, and how are coping behaviors being employed and by whom when differences between the working pair exists? Full-time international graduate students having at least one year of graduate school experience in U.S. academic settings and faculty advisors who had experience in advising international graduate students participated in this study. A total of 20 international students participated. All the participants completed the Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory (KAI) as a measure of problem-solving style. Of the 20 that completed the inventory, 14 participants from 10 different countries agreed to participate in a semi-structure interview. Additionally, five faculty advisors completed the KAI inventory and three faculty advisors participated in an interview. Findings of the study are1) a link exists between participants' problem-solving styles and their expectations for the advising relationship; 2) cultural difference outside academia had no impact on academic progress of international students; 3) acculturation into American academic culture seemed essential for academic success of international students in U.S academic settings; 4) international students wanted their home country culture to be acknowledged in a multicultural settings; 5) success of advising relationship seemed to be dependent upon how much the advisor and the advisee exhibited coping behavior; 6) acknowledging the differences and accepting a person in a holistic manner as a separate identity worked best in a multicultural settings; and 7) developing a human connect between the advisor and advisee seemed to be vital for a successful and academically productive advising relationship.\",","16584":"\"description-degree\": \"MSLFS\",","16585":"\"description-provenance\": [","16586":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-01T08:00:23Z (GMT).

Following the removal of Ukrainian authority from the peninsula, the Kremlin focused simultaneously on legitimizing the annexation via an electoral reform in Crimea and fermenting political unrest in the Donbas. As violence broke out in the Donbas, anti-Ukrainian government militias were formed by defecting Ukrainian security forces members, local volunteers, and volunteers from Russia. The Kremlin provided extensive support for these militias which sometimes even came in the form of direct military intervention by conventional Russian forces. However, the use of state-sponsored militias by Russia is not a new phenomenon. Since the end of the Cold War, the Russian Federation has been relying on militias to help stabilize local security environments, and more recently, achieve foreign security policy objectives in the Near Abroad. By tracking the history of Vostok (East) Battalion during its two distinctly different iterations, first as a militia for the Yamadayev family which operated primarily in Chechnya as well as briefly in South Ossetia and Lebanon and then as separatist formation in Eastern Ukraine, my thesis seeks to examine why Russia uses militias. Using the theoretical frameworks of principle-agent relations and organizational hierarchy, my thesis examines post-Soviet military reforms to contextualize the Kremlin's rationale for utilizing militia groups as well as analyzing the costs and benefits Moscow ultimately incurs when it leverages militias as force projection assets domestically and in the Near Abroad.\",","16627":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","16628":"\"description-provenance\": [","16629":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-01T08:00:31Z (GMT).

Honeycomb panels can carry significant load but are most vulnerable to structural failure at their joints where panels connect.  This research shows that predicting sandwich panel joint capability using finite element analysis (FEA) is possible.  This allows for the potential elimination of coupon testing early in a spacecraft design program to determine joint capability.  Linear finite element analysis (FEA) in NX Nastran was used to show that adhesive failure can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by including a fillet model on the edge of the fitting.  Predicting the ultimate failure of a joint using linear FEA requires that engineering judgment be used to determine whether failure of certain bonds in a fitting will lead to ultimate joint failure or if other bonds will continue to carry the joint's load.  The linear FEA model is also able to predict when the initiation of core failure will begin.  This has the limitation that the joint will still be able to continue to carry significantly more load prior to joint ultimate failure even after the core has begun to buckle.  A nonlinear analysis is performed using modified Riks' method in Abaqus FEA to show that this failure mode is predictable.  The modified Riks' analysis showed that nonlinear post-buckling analysis of a honeycomb coupon can predict ultimate core failure with good accuracy.  This solution requires a very high quality mesh in order to continue to run after buckling has begun and requires imperfections based on linear buckling mode shapes and thickness tolerance on the honeycomb core to be applied.\",","16675":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16676":"\"description-provenance\": [","16677":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-05T00:27:33Z (GMT).

It is known that with the right combination of velocity, geometry, and surface treatment, a cavity of air can be formed behind an impacting body and extended for a considerable distance. Other investigators have shown that the time and depth of the cone when this cavity collapses and seals follows a different power law for flat objects such as disks, then it does for slender objects such as cylinders. Intuitively it can be expected that a more slender body will have less drag and that the streamlined shape will not push the fluid out of it's way at impact to the same extent as a more blunt body, therefore forming a smaller cavity behind it. With a smaller initial cavity, the time and depth of it's eventual collapse can be expected to be less than that of a much more blunt object, such as a flat disk. To study this, a numerical model has been developed to simulate cones with the same base radius but different angles impacting on a liquid surface over a range of velocities, showing how the seal depth, time at cavity seal, and drag forces change. In order to ensure the numerical model is accurate, it is compared with experimental data including high speed video and measurements made of the force with time. It is expected that the results will fall inside the power law exponents reported by other authors for very blunt objects such as disks on one end of the spectrum, and long slender cylinders on the other. Furthermore, we expect that the drag force exerted on the cones will become lower as the L/D of the cone is increased.\",","16718":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16719":"\"description-provenance\": [","16720":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-06T08:00:32Z (GMT).

A total of 96 sows (parity, 3.5 \u00b1 0.2; body condition score (BCS), 2.5 \u00b1 0.07) were weaned (h 0) after a 24.8 \u00b1 0.6 d lactation on five participating small swine farms and allocated to one of four treatment groups1) TRT1(n = 24) OvuGel applied intravaginally at h 96 and AI at h 120; 2) TRT2(n = 24) P.G. 600\u00ae (400 IU eCG and 200 IU hCG, Merck Animal Health, Inc., De Sota, KS) injected intramuscularly at weaning, OvuGel at h 96 and AI at h 120; 3) TRT3(n = 24) P.G. 600 at weaning, and AI at 0 and 24 h after first detection of estrus; and 4) TRT4(n = 24) AI at 0 and 24 h after first detection of estrus. Treatments 1 and 2 were FTAI protocols with sows being inseminated without regard to estrus onset.  Treatments 3 and 4 were consistent with current industry AI practices. The proportion of females displaying estrus by d 7 post-weaning was greater (P < 0.05) for sows that received OvuGel (94.5 %) compared to sows that did not receive OvuGel (82.2 %).  There were no effects (P > 0.05) of P.G. 600 or P.G. 600 x OvuGel on females displaying estrus by d 7 or d 10 post-weaning.  Weaning to estrus interval was decreased (P < 0.05) for sows that received P.G. 600 (4.9 \u00b1 0.4 d) compared to sows that did not receive P.G. 600 (5.4 \u00b1 0.4 d). There were no effects (P > 0.05) of OvuGel or P.G. 600 x OvuGel on the weaning-to-estrus interval.  There were no effects of P.G. 600, OvuGel or P.G. 600 x OvuGel (P > 0.1) on pregnancy rate (total sows pregnant/inseminated) (61.2 %), total litter size (11.3), number born dead (1.0) or number of mummies (0.2).  There was an effect (P < 0.05) of P.G. 600 x OvuGel on total born live (10.2). Sows treated with OvuGel had a greater number of live piglets born per semen dose (5.4) compared to sows that did not receive OvuGel (3.2) (P < 0.05). These results suggest that FTAI protocols may be employed on small-scale pig farms without compromising reproductive performance.\",","16762":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16763":"\"description-provenance\": [","16764":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-12T08:00:38Z (GMT).

Also, small plot tillage experiments were conducted from 2013-2016 assessing no-till, conventional tillage, minimum tillage, and strip-tillage as well as the subsequent effects of these systems on four cotton varieties. Biennial strip-tillage produced similar lint yields to annual strip-tillage at 3 of 4 locations, with only one location showing a significant difference in lint yield of 135 kg ha-1. Persistence of subsoil tillage within the row from the previous year was observed at some locations and plant heights were not different at all locations, although annual strip-tillage provided deeper potential rooting depths both early season and at harvest. In short term tillage systems, minimal penalties in plant growth and lint yield were observed in no-till verses the other systems, primarily associated with greater soil compaction, shorter plant heights, and lower yields. An overall 8% reduction in yield was found with no-till systems, with no significant differences in yield among tillage systems observed in any year. Varietal effects on plant growth and yield were observed annually, with FM 1944 GLB2 being the shortest plants, and DP 1321 B2RF having the tallest plants. No tillage by variety interaction was observed, supporting the idea that varieties respond similarly across tillage systems.\",","16805":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16806":"\"description-provenance\": [","16807":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-19T08:00:14Z (GMT).

Tall fescue, the dominant forage in much of the U.S., harbors an endophyte that produces toxic ergot alkaloids.  Diluting the sward with other forages can reduce ergot alkaloid concentrations, but it is unknown how shade impacts alkaloid production and productivity of different forage mixtures. This study tested the effects of increasing shade and mixture complexity on sward yield, botanical composition, nutritive characteristics and ergot alkaloid concentrations.  Slatted shade structures created 30, 50, and 70% shade compared to full sun.  Three forage mixtures were evaluated (SIMPLE = tall fescue and white clover; INTERMEDIATE = SIMPLE + orchardgrass and red clover; and COMPLEX = INTERMEDIATE + Kentucky bluegrass, birdsfoot trefoil, and alfalfa).   Fifty and 70% shade reduced yield while red clover and orchardgrass dominated shaded swards.  Birdsfoot trefoil, Kentucky bluegrass, and white clover did not perform well in any treatment.  Nutritive value declined beneath shade in spring and fall.  Sward ergot alkaloid concentration increased beneath shade in simple mixtures because of greater proportions of tall fescue.  In the intermediate and complex mixtures, ergot alkaloids were diluted by other forage species and was not affected by shade.  This illustrates the importance of incorporating multiple species into the sward.  Low light levels may not have been sufficient to meet the forages' high energetic demands in the spring.  Even though total forage production or nutritive value may be sacrificed during part of the year, this may be compensated for by diverse swards diluting ergot alkaloid concentrations.\",","16854":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16855":"\"description-provenance\": [","16856":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-19T08:00:21Z (GMT).

In many cultures birds are tied to ideas of freedom, power, and the otherworldly.  Preconceived notions of a phoenix exist across many cultures as well, but for this project I wanted to create my own interpretation.  While working, I drew upon my admiration of birds for their qualities of strength, beauty, and curiosity to infuse into the project.  Inspired by the dynamic and detailed works of naturalists like John James Audubon, I took the opportunity to make my own observations and records of birds.   I began exploring different processes of digitizing three-dimensional forms by scanning bird skins.  However, due to the nature of fibrous and reflective materials (of which birds are often both) I ran into challenges that made accurate and detailed representation difficult if not impossible.  From there I made the decision to pursue a more imaginative artistic approach to the project.    More than just a homage to feathers and birds, this project represents the continued value of artists in the field of preservation and their ability to push visuals further with their own observations where automation and digitization fall short.  Using life references I created my own textures and forms with details meant to emulate my favorite aspects of the birds that inspired me throughout my journey.  Larger-than-life, projected stereoscopic 3D allows the audience to see details clearly and  enhances the dynamic quality of the piece; both very important elements that needed to shine through in the final artwork.  Plumage is made possible through the use of the Cyclorama, a  series of convex screens that surround an audience and allow them to appreciate scenes  projected in stereoscopic 3D.\",","16944":"\"description-degree\": \"MFA\",","16945":"\"description-provenance\": [","16946":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-22T08:00:21Z (GMT).

Large predators, such as esocids, are often at the center of these conflicts because of their capacity to alter fish populations. Such a conflict certainly exists between the Muskellunge Esox masquinongy and Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu fisheries of the New River, Virginia. Following the institution of a 42-in minimum-length limit (MLL) on Muskellunge, bass anglers feared that increased Muskellunge abundance might be negatively affecting Smallmouth Bass via increased predation. In order to ascertain the impacts of the 42-in MLL, I estimated the demographics, abundance, and food habits of Muskellunge combined with bioenergetics modeling to assess changes (i) in the quality of the Muskellunge fishery and (ii) in Muskellunge predation on Smallmouth Bass. Additionally, given the likelihood of future regulations to incite similar concerns from bass anglers, I modeled alternative length-limit regulations (iii) to assess their potential to improve fishery quality, thereby laying the groundwork for managers to address angler concerns before they arise. I found substantial increases in population size structure and in average adult density of Muskellunge since the institution of the 42-in MLL, but bioenergetics modeling did not indicate a notable increase in the consumption of Smallmouth Bass. I also found that high MLLs (e.g., 48-in) were likely to promote the largest increases in trophy production of Muskellunge compared to low MLLs or protected-slot limits (PSLs). This study suggests that the current Muskellunge population likely plays a small role in shaping Smallmouth Bass population dynamics and production in the New River; and lays the groundwork for predicting how the impact of Muskellunge on Smallmouth Bass might change under alternative regulations.\",","16992":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","16993":"\"description-provenance\": [","16994":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-22T08:01:02Z (GMT).

The recording of the sound field, the spatialization and the development of the loudspeaker arrays are some of the greatest challenges. In this thesis, these challenges for improving immersive audio will be explored. First, there will be a short introduction about 3D audio and a review about the state of the art technology and research. Next, the thesis will provide an introduction to 3D loudspeaker arrays and describe the systems used during this research. Furthermore, the development of a new 16-element 3rd order sound field microphone will be described. Afterwards, different spatial audio algorithms such as higher order ambisonics, wave field synthesis and vector based amplitude panning will be described, analyzed and compared. For each spatialization algorithm, the quality of soundfield reproduction will be quantified using listener perception tests for clarity and sound source localization.\",","17039":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17040":"\"description-provenance\": [","17041":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-04-25T22:28:55Z (GMT).

To fully comprehend the nature of personal impacts, I took a primarily qualitative approach, using participant observation and a series of survey questionnaires. This study reveals that the visitor's construction of personal meaning is achieved through the interaction between the visitor's prior knowledge, quality social interaction on the tour and the fulfillment of the desire for an 'authentic' experience. With this finding, I suggest considering learning in an ecotourism setting as personal change and provide practical suggestions for encouraging all visitors to achieve personal understanding.\",","17081":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17082":"\"description-provenance\": [","17083":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-03T08:00:17Z (GMT).

Public and public prioritization as well as message themes, message styles, and message consistency were analyzed in research questions one A through F. Relationship management theory emphasizes that the organization-public relationship is key to organizational success. Constructs of trust, openness, and transparency are important measures of this organization-public relationship. Thus, research question two analyzed the frequencies of these constructs in public commentary on Target and blogger related content. Findings indicate that there was overall campaign consistency in both message themes and message styles across Target, the bloggers, and their publics. Moreover, the campaign prioritized the social media platform Instagram and, in doing so, created an intentional online social community of strategic publics that helped facilitate trust between Target, the bloggers, and their publics. Trust was the most frequently used construct of relationship management theory in public commentary, transparency seemed to be assumed in trust, despite the low frequency findings. Target mainly prioritized small-bodied white models/bloggers despite the campaign's inclusive messages and the greater opportunities for public interaction when medium- and large-bodied, non-white models/bloggers were featured. Finally, campaign disclosure and disclosure placement by Target partners were inconsistent across social media platforms which remains troubling in light of FTC requirements and Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA) Code of Ethics guidelines.\",","17123":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","17124":"\"description-provenance\": [","17125":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-04T08:00:19Z (GMT).

The primary research question that will be supported by this research, is whether or not Anna Politkovskaya's gender impacted her work, the reception of her work, and her overall experience as a human rights advocate in Chechnya. Anna Politkovskaya is being used as a primary case study due to the volume and breadth of the reports that she produced, and because she was the most well-known reporter in Chechnya during the Second Chechen War, giving her a wider audience.  The work of other female journalists will be covered, but those works will serve a secondary purpose of aiding in looking at how Politkovskaya's journalistic legacy impacted other female journalists within Chechnya.  The current state of affairs within the Chechen Republic is one of limited civil liberties and increasing violence on behalf of the authoritarian state government towards advocacy groups and opposition parties. The environment for human rights has not notably improved since the official conclusion of the Second Chechen War, but the level of media attention dedicated to issues there has dramatically decreased.   Chechnya is currently lacking a voice of passionate reason, and as a result lacks an effective advocate for civilian interests, which was the role previously filled by Politkovskaya.\",","17167":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","17168":"\"description-provenance\": [","17169":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-04T08:00:26Z (GMT).

This thesis argues the Sverigedemokraterna do not constitute a political party, but remain a populist movement within Swedish politics, are not right-wing but rather a lagom-inspired hybrid, and the stabilizing effects of the culture of lagom prevents the permanence of extremism in Swedish politics. The increase in immigrants from predominantly Muslim states due to the Arab Spring and the Syrian civil war stoke the anti-Islamic rhetoric of this nationalist group, but did not cause their rapid ascent and neither did the entry of Sweden into the European Economic Community. The Sverigedemokraterna are a single-point culmination of a century of nationalist and fascist groups splitting and merging within Sweden, but as other groups continue to appear the SD cannot be the only culmination.\",","17218":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","17219":"\"description-provenance\": [","17220":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-06T08:00:12Z (GMT).

The on-field portion of this research investigated high magnitude head impacts that youth football players experience in games and practices.  With previously validated data collection methods, linear and rotational head accelerations from head impacts were collected.  Over the course of two seasons, 79 total player-seasons resulted in over 13,000 impacts.  A small subset of these, 979 impacts exceeding 40 g, represented the focus of this research as these impacts pose the greatest risk of injury to individuals.  Some tackling drills in practice were found to have higher acceleration severities than those observed in games.  How practice activities are conducted also contributes towards the overall high magnitude head impact exposure for practice, not just the practice drill itself.  Within games, players who are running backs and linebackers played most frequently and experienced higher magnitude impacts more often than their teammates.  Data were also collected from all players off the field.  Each player completed balance assessments at the beginning and end of the season to allow for comparison, even in absence of a clinically-diagnosed concussion.  Current balance assessments were observed to fall short for detecting postural control differences in this youth population.  Modifications to these assessments were recommended that might allow for further insights.  Research presented in this thesis will inform youth football organizations as they continue to develop strategies to enhance player safety and mitigate head impact exposure.\",","17357":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17358":"\"description-provenance\": [","17359":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-16T08:00:13Z (GMT).

The recent application of the term racialization to discuss the Muslim experience in the west has encouraged scholars such as Leon Moosavi, Saher Selod, Mythili Rajiva, Ming H. Chen and others, to engage in critical discourse within the scholarship of race and ethnicity regarding this often-neglected population. It is due to the unique, and gendered relationship that the female Muslim-American population has with the United States, particularly as a result of 9/11 and the label of 'oppressed' being imposed upon them, that it is important to comprehend how specifically Muslim-American women experience racialization. While these studies have broadened the understanding of how Muslims are, and continue to be othered, few studies have focused on the specific areas within public and private spaces where this marginalized group is racialized. This study attempts to fill this gap in existing research by examining how peers, mass media, educational institutions, law enforcement, family, and religious communities racialize Muslim-American women, and how these gendered experiences shape their racialized sense of self. In doing so, it also examines the impact of religious, racial, ethnic and cultural signifiers on the female Muslim-American experience of racialization, and demonstrates how these women employ certain strategies of resistance and coping mechanisms to deal with their racialization.\",","17401":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17402":"\"description-provenance\": [","17403":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-16T08:00:19Z (GMT).

Sentinel traps were used to survey for parasitoids of frugivorous drosophilids in Virginia fruit cropping systems, and determine if parasitoids were attacking invasive flies Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) and Zaprionus indianus Gupta (DipteraDrosophilidae) in the field. Two parasitoids of frugivorous drosophilids, Leptopilina boulardi (Barbotin, Carton, and Kelner-Pillault) (HymenopteraFigitidae) and Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) (HymenopteraPteromalidae), were reared, but only one P. vindemiae was reared from D. suzukii, and no parasitoids were reared from Z. indianus. Most parasitoids were reared from alternate host Drosophila melanogaster Meigen and other wild drosophilids. 2.) The ability of these parasitoids to attack D. melanogaster, D. suzukii and Z. indianus under controlled conditions was tested. Larval parasitoid L. boulardi did not develop on D. suzukii or Z. indianus, just D. melanogaster. Pupal parasitoid P. vindemiae successfully developed on all three fly species, but also increased pupal fly mortality. 3.) Olfactometry was used to ascertain if L. boulardi and P. vindemiae are selective about the type of fruit their hosts feed in. Results showed that among cherry, raspberry, blueberry, grape, and banana, L. boulardi preferred raspberry and banana to cherry, and preferred grape least, but no fruit was most preferred. Insufficient data were obtained for P. vindemiae.      We conclude that parasitoids of Virginia are unlikely to provide effective biological control for D. suzukii or Z. indianus, and classical biological control should be investigated as a pest management option. Olfactometry results indicate tritrophic selectivity by Drosophila parasitoids, suggesting multiple parasitoids could be required for effective biological control.\",","17548":"\"description-degree\": \"MSLFS\",","17549":"\"description-provenance\": [","17550":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-19T08:00:17Z (GMT).

The prognosis for horses with DDFT lesions to return to previous levels of performance is poor. Treatment options are limited; consisting of conservative therapy, desmotomy of the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon, injection of the digital sheath or navicular bursa, navicular bursoscopy or intralesional injection. Intralesional injection of biologic therapeutics shows promise in tendon healing, with increased number of experimental and clinical studies finding positive results. However, accurate injection of DDFT lesions within the hoof is difficult and requires general anesthesia. The Hallmarq open, low-field MRI unit was used to develop an MRI-guided technique to inject structures within the hoof. This procedure has been previously reported for injecting the collateral ligaments of the distal interphalangeal joint. Four clinical cases of deep digital flexor tendinopathy have been treated with MRI-guided injections using a similar technique.   The aim of this study was to evaluate accuracy of a technique for injection of the deep digital flexor tendon within the hoof using MRI-guidance, which could be performed in standing patients. We hypothesized that injection of the DDFT within the hoof could be accurately guided using open low-field MRI to target either the lateral or medial lobe at a specific location. Ten cadaver limbs were positioned in an open, low-field MRI unit to mimic a standing horse. Each DDFT lobe was assigned to have a proximal (adjacent to the proximal aspect of the navicular bursa) or distal (adjacent to the navicular bone) injection. A titanium needle was inserted into each tendon lobe, guided by T1-weighted transverse images acquired simultaneously during injection. Oil-based colored dye was injected as a marker. Post-injection MRI and gross sections were assessed by three blinded investigators experienced in equine MRI. The success of injection as evaluated on gross section was 85% (70% proximal, 100% distal). The success of injection as evaluated by MRI was 65% (60% proximal, 70% distal). There was no significant difference between the success of injecting the medial versus lateral lobe. The major limitation of this study was the use of cadaver limbs with normal tendons. The authors concluded that injection of the DDFT within the hoof is possible using MRI guidance. Future work should be focused on using the techniqe in live horses with tendon lesions, and more clinical studies are needed to determine the most efficacious biologic therapeutic for tendon healing.\",","17642":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17643":"\"description-provenance\": [","17644":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-23T08:00:19Z (GMT).

Decreasing the feed consumed, measured here as dry matter intake (DMI), would therefore be advantageous to producers. However, this decrease could result in cows that do not supply the necessary energy to maintain high production, growth, and reproduction. Measures of feed efficiency try to capture important energy expenditures to ensure that cows consume less while maintaining production. Feed efficiency in this study is measured in residual feed intake (RFI), which is calculated as the difference between DMI and expected DMI based on production and growth measures. However, the RFI model does not capture the energy stores required for reproduction; therefore, selection for RFI may lead to reduced reproductive performance. In this thesis, I explored the phenotypic and genetic relationships between RFI, DMI, and reproductive performance as measured by number of services (NS), days open (DO), and days to first calving (DFC). First, ANOVA tests and phenotypic correlations determined the phenotypic relationship between the traits. Then, heritability and genetic correlations were used to estimate the genetic parameters. Phenotypically, results indicated mixed relationships between traits. Heritability estimates were low for reproductive traits and moderate for DMI and RFI. There was no unfavorable genetic relationship between DMI or RFI with any of the reproductive traits. Therefore, neither selection for DMI nor RFI will unfavorably impact reproduction.\",","17685":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17686":"\"description-provenance\": [","17687":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-23T08:00:28Z (GMT).

Community structure and function were hydrologically altered by 19th and 20th century ditches installed to lower water levels and enable early timber harvesting. Contemporary forest communities are comprised of maturing remnants from selective timber harvesting that ended in the early 1970s. Red maple (Acer rubrum) has become the dominant species across GDS, encroaching on or replacing the historical mosaic of cypress (Taxodium spp.)/tupelo (Nyssa spp.), Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), and pocosin (Pinus spp.). Moreover, peat soil has been exposed to more unsaturated conditions resulting in carbon loss through decomposition and increased peat fire frequency and severity. Installation of ditch control structures aim to control drainage and re-establish historical hydrology, vegetation communities, peat accretion rates, and fire regime. To help inform restoration and management, we conducted two complimentary studies to test hypotheses regarding hydrologic influences on vegetation, peat depths, and peat fire vulnerability. First, we found thicker peat, lower maple importance, and higher species richness at wetter sites (e.g., higher mean water levels). In our second study, we evaluated the integrated effects of peat properties and water level dynamics on peat fire vulnerability. We found decreased burn vulnerability with increased wetness, suggesting that the driest sites were always at risk to burn, whereas the wettest sites never approached fire risk conditions. Together our findings demonstrate strong hydrologic controls on GDS ecosystem structure and function, thereby informing water level management for restoration goals.\",","17728":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17729":"\"description-provenance\": [","17730":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-23T08:00:35Z (GMT).

Persistence of such negative effects may translate to losses in forest productivity over a rotation.  During the fall and winter of 1989, numerous salvage logging operations were conducted during high soil moisture conditions on wet pine flats in the lower coastal plain of South Carolina following Hurricane Hugo.  A long-term experiment (split-plot within an unbalanced randomized complete block design) allowed assessment of long term effects of rutted and compacted primary skid trails and subsequent site preparation on soil properties and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) productivity.  The experiment had 12 blocks, four levels of site preparation as the whole plot factor (bedding, disking with bedding, disking, and no site preparation), and two levels of traffic as the subplot factor (primary skid trail, no obvious traffic).  After 23 years, bedding and disking with bedding treatments effectively enhanced soil physical properties and stand productivity via promoting greater survival and stocking, but had little effect on the size of individual trees relative to disking and no site preparation treatments.  Primary skid trails significantly reduced the size of individual trees, but had no appreciable long term effects on soil properties or stand productivity after 23 years.  The study suggests that bedding is the most efficient practice to enhance soil properties, seedling survival, and stand productivity on wet sites.  However, site preparation is not necessary for these soils and sites, if strictly intended to restore soil properties and stand productivity in primary skid trails.  Reduction in individual tree sizes on primary skid trails emphasizes benefits in minimizing the spatial extent of disturbance.\",","17777":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17778":"\"description-provenance\": [","17779":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-23T08:00:42Z (GMT).

Youth players have differences in anthropometry, physiology, impact exposure, and potentially injury tolerance that should be considered in future youth-specific helmets and standards. This thesis begins by investigating the current standards and relating them to on-field data. The standard drop tests represented the most severe on-field impacts, and the performance of the youth and varsity helmet did not differ. There likely is not a need for a youth-specific standard as the current standard has essentially eliminated the catastrophic head injuries it tests for. As more is known about concussion, standards specific to the youth population can be developed. The second portion of this thesis compares the impact performance between 8 matched youth and varsity helmet models, using linear acceleration, rotational acceleration, and concussion correlate. It was found that helmet performance did not differ between the youth and varsity helmets, likely attributed to testing to the same standard. The final portion of this feature is aimed at advancing STAR for youth and varsity football helmets by including linear and rotational head kinematics. For varsity helmets, an adult surrogate is used for impact tests which are weighted based on on-field data collected from collegiate football players. For youth helmets, a youth surrogate is used and tests are weighted based on data collected from youth players.\",","17823":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17824":"\"description-provenance\": [","17825":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-24T08:00:18Z (GMT).

The most effective means of control is through the use of FHB resistant cultivars that are developed through gene pyramiding and incorporation of various sources of resistance. Resistance identified in winter barley cultivar Eve has been identified in Virginia Tech's Small Grains Breeding Program. The objectives of this study are to validate resistance and identify additional resistance QTL, and identify tightly linked and diagnostic markers for use in MAS programs. A population of F5:7 RILs derived from the cross Eve/Doyce were evaluated for FHB resistance. FHB incidence (Inc), FHB severity (Sev), Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK), and deoxynivalenol (DON) were assessed over 2014-15 and 2015-16 at Blacksburg, VA, Mount Holly, VA, Kinston, NC, and Lexington, KY. A QTL on chromosome 6H associated with FHB Sev, FDK, and DON was identified. The QTL accounted for as high as 14.5% of the phenotypic variation for DON accumulation, 8.3% for FHB Sev, and 11.87% to 17.63% for FDK. The QTL marker region spans 56.5 to 66.6 cM with flanking markers SCRI_RS_147342 and Bmag0613. QTL for morphological traits, heading date and height, were found in the same region as the FHB resistance traits. Diagnostic SNP makers associated with the FHB resistance QTL identified can be used for FHB resistance identification in MAS breeding programs to incorporate and pyramid resistance QTL and genes into other plant material.\",","17866":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17867":"\"description-provenance\": [","17868":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-24T08:00:34Z (GMT).

A quandary however arises due to the fact that calibration methods depend on accurate knowledge of line parameters, and estimation of these parameters depend on calibrated measurements. Traditional methods of determining the parameters may not be the most accurate due to a variety of fluctuations possible on the system, which is why real-time estimation could prove beneficial.

Objective To compare a method of radioiodine dose determination that utilized thyroid scintigraphy with a standard fixed dose for treatment of feline hyperthyroidism.   MethodsFifty-seven and 23 cats were in the novel and fixed dose groups, respectively. Cats with a percent dose uptake as determined using 99mTcO4- uptake on thyroid scintigraphy <5%, 5-10%, and >10% were designated to receive 3 mCi, 3.5 mCi, or 4.5 mCi of 131I, respectively, administered subcutaneously. Radioiodine dose was adjusted by thyroid size, determined by evaluating the thyroid:salivary size ratio (T:S) and categorized as <5, 5-10, and >10. If the thyroid size fell into a higher dosing category than percent uptake, the dose was increased accordingly.  Cats in the fixed dose group received 4.5 mCi of 131I.  Six months after treatment, cats were determined to be euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid based on serum T4 concentrations relative to an established reference interval. Univariate analysis using Chi-square was used to determine associations between treatment and outcome. ResultsThere was no difference in outcome between the novel and fixed dose treatments.  Euthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism developed in 61, 30, and 9% of cats in the fixed dose group, respectively compared to 58, 26, and 16% in the novel dose group. ConclusionsA modified fixed dose method of radioiodine based upon thyroid size and percent dose uptake was ineffective in improving outcomes over a standard fixed dose method.\",","17960":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","17961":"\"description-provenance\": [","17962":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-25T08:00:14Z (GMT).

One strategy to increase physical activity is to use more active transportation, defined as walking or biking for transit. Besides increasing physical activity levels, active transportation can provide other benefits such as decreased air pollution from cars. College campuses provide opportunities for active transportation as most residences are close to campus. Therefore, we examined reasons for use and barriers to active transportation in students living in a community connected to a large university via a 1.9 mile, paved protected trail. Two pedestrian and bicycle counters were placed to find the number of walkers and bikers on the trail per day and students were recruited to take an online survey. We found that more people used the trail during the weekday compared to the weekend. Students did not receive much support from their friends and family to use the trail. Users of the trail were more likely to believe that using active transportation helps protect the environment while non-users were uncomfortable using a bike. Barriers included the time it took to use the trail and the need to carry items. Both users and non-users indicated that a financial incentive would motivate them to use the trail more. We conclude that non-users may be uncomfortable using a bike and worry about carrying their items for class. Changing university parking fees, providing bike lessons, and placing signs with directions and time to campus may increase active transportation to the university via this trail.\",","18041":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","18042":"\"description-provenance\": [","18043":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-31T08:00:15Z (GMT).

Simultaneously, they represent our deepest fears as well as our desire to connect with our primal ancestry. Today, werewolves are portrayed negatively, associated with violence, cruelty, cannibalism, and general malevolence. However, in ages past, legends depicted them not as monsters, but as a range of neutral to benevolent individuals, such as traveling companions, guardians, and knights. The robust legacy of the werewolf spans from prehistory, through ancient Greece and Rome, to the Middle Ages, into the Early Modern period, and finally into present-day popular culture. Over the ages, the view of the werewolf has become distorted. Media treatment of werewolves is associated with inferior writing, lacking in thought, depth, and meaning. Werewolves as characters or creatures are now generally seen as single-minded and one-dimensional, and they want nothing more than to kill, devour, and possibly violate humans. Hollywood depictions have resulted in the destruction of the true meanings behind werewolf legends that fascinated and terrified humans for so many ages. If these negative trends were reversed, perhaps entertainment might not only discover again some of the true meanings behind the werewolf myth, but also take the first steps toward reversing negative portrayals of wolves themselves, which humans have, for eons, wrongfully stigmatized and portrayed as evil, resulting in wolves receiving crueler treatment than virtually any other animal. To revive the many questions posed by lycanthropy, entertainment must show respect to the rich history of the legend \u2014 and rediscover the benevolent werewolf.\",","18085":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","18086":"\"description-provenance\": [","18087":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-01T08:00:13Z (GMT).

Recently, younger women have been coloring their hair combinations of white, silver, and gray and posting images of their style on instagram with the #grannyhair designation. In this study we use an intersectional approach to age and gender relations to explore this phenomenon. Previous studies show that women's behaviors and presentations of aging are policed by cultural standards of age-appropriate appearance and performance, particularly in regards to their hair. Qualitative content analysis of #grannyhair images are examined to assess the extent of age-based stereotypes and policing of age-appropriate behavior and appearance. This study found that instagram users engaged in this trend did not challenge age relations. Rather, boundaries of age-appropriate behaviors enacted in the #grannyhair trend are largely set by younger users. The ways in which young users utilize ageist stereotypes as a way to emphasize the contrast between their stylistic choices and their status as young attractive women framed the #grannyhair trend as one of appropriation. That is, young women adopted gray, white, and silver hair as a cultural symbol and changed its original meaning as a marker of old age. Conversations among both young and old instagram users echoing previous literature that details the contentious relationships old women have with their aging bodies, and hair specifically.\",","18147":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","18148":"\"description-provenance\": [","18149":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-01T08:00:21Z (GMT).

First, I examine the history of Estonian nationalism.  I examine the Estonian nationalist narrative from its beginning during the Livonian Crusade, the founding of Estonian nationalist thought in the late 1800s with a German model of nationalism, the conditions of the Soviet occupation, and the role of song festivals in Estonian nationalism.  Second, I give a brief overview of the economic systems of Soviet and post-Soviet Estonia.  Finally, I examine the impact of nationalism on the Estonian economy.  To do this, I discuss the nature of nationalist economy, the presence of an ethno-national divide between the Estonians and Russians, and the impact of nationalist policies in citizenship, education, property rights, and geographical location.

According to 'conceptualist' interpretations, intuitions depend for their generation on the activity of the understanding. According to 'nonconceptualist' interpretations, at least some intuitions do not depend for their generation on the activity of the understanding. I argue that although the conceptualism/nonconceptualism debate has brought greater clarity to a number of issues within Kant's critical philosophy, the debate partially rests on a conflation of two importantly distinct representational states, namely 'intuition' [Anschaaung] and 'perception' [Wahrnehmung]. I argue that once this distinction is noted, many of the passages that would appear to threaten a nonconceptualist interpretation lose their force. In addition, I argue that if we understand the conceptualist claim in terms of the kind of structure a particular representational state possesses, then we have good reason to reject the idea that, for Kant, sensory experience is fundamentally conceptual in character.\",","18283":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","18284":"\"description-provenance\": [","18285":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-04T08:00:11Z (GMT).

A pretest survey (n = 577) investigated the prominence word-of-mouth communication has on video game information sharing amongst college students, finding it to be the most common method of sharing and obtaining game information. The main experiment (n = 227) examined participants' intent to share information after being exposed to a video game trailer manipulated to emphasize variations of core video game characteristics (control, narrative and mechanics) and emotional appeals (control, awe and hedonic). There were no findings suggesting the manipulations had a significant effect on participants' intent to share; however, those who reported first-person shooters as their favorite genre reported significantly more intent to share. Conceptualized through Social Exchange Theory and Social Identity Theory; the experiment also explored motivations to share based on exchange value, and gamer identity. Implications for our understanding of motivations to share game information based on social networks and content characteristics are discussed.\",","18328":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","18329":"\"description-provenance\": [","18330":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-05T08:00:14Z (GMT).

A second part of the study analyzed employee posts on the organization's internal website to identify the congruency of organizational value meaning and manifestation between the organization and its employees. Results from the study found presence of five of the seven excellence principles in Carilion's public relations and that three of the five organizational values are congruent between the organization and its employees. Results suggest that Carilion Clinic's public relations efforts are contributing to organizational culture. Efforts by Carilion's public relations successfully communicate organizational values and foster a participative culture. This case study shows that public relations is beneficial to fostering organizational culture and that excellence principles as developed by the excellence theory can serve as a guide for organizations when implementing and evaluating public relations practices.\",","18372":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","18373":"\"description-provenance\": [","18374":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-06T08:00:19Z (GMT).

I argue that reading poetry requires a skillset that must be learned, practiced, and refined. While close reading is traditionally trained in college classrooms, such spaces cannot reach broad audiences. To address this dearth, I have developed a web app that applies interactive learning strategies, through a series of exercises, to cultivate expert reading practices in novice users. Close Reading will guide users through poems by Robert Frost. With each poem, users will progress through exercises grounded in the practices of expert readers. For instance, users will block poems into sections to allow a chunking of the material, slowing down novice reading speeds. Another exercise cognitively models the act of reading by displaying the sequential thoughts of a reader making sense of a work. Furthermore, Socratic questioning will attempt to stimulate an internal dialogue to foster focus and interpretation. These exercises will build on one another and attempt to replicate pedagogical processes observed in the classroom. Performing these pedagogical exercises will provide a resource for developing the skillset necessary for poetry appreciation. This ambitious digital humanities project experiments with a new venue for pedagogy and poetry, promoting an engagement with the public frequently neglected in academic work.\",","18418":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","18419":"\"description-provenance\": [","18420":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-06T08:00:33Z (GMT).

This thesis seeks to determine which elements of Scottish political and cultural history have led to its modern day civic culture, in the form of a civic nationalism, or patriotism. It askswhy is Scottish nationalism unique, and why does it matter? To answer, I have broken down the thesis into three main chapters that consider the theories of nationalism that are significant to the study of Scottish nationalism, the foundations of Scottish nationalism, and how Scottish nationalism manifests itself in civic contexts. The results reflect that Scottish civic culture deeply permeates the nation's politics. Even when given the opportunity for independence, Scotland chose to remain a part of the United Kingdom in order to maintain its interests with the European Union.

In actual engine representative conditions, the upstream misalignments have effects on turbines performance through the nozzle guide vane passages. The current experimental aerodynamic investigation over the nozzle guide vane passage was concentrated on the backward-facing step of upstream misalignments. The tests were performed using two types of vane endwall platforms in a 2D linear cascadeflat endwall and axisymmetric converging endwall. The test conditions were a Mach number of 0.85, Re_ex  1.5*10^6 based on exit condition and axial chord, and a high freestream turbulence intensity (16%), at the Virginia tech transonic cascade wind tunnel. The experimental results from the surface flow visualization and the five-hole probe measurements at the vane-passage exit were compared with the two cases with and without the backward-facing step for both types of endwall platforms. As a main source of secondary flow, a horseshoe vortex at stagnation region of the leading edge of the vane directly influences other secondary flows. The intensity of the vortex is associated with boundary layer thickness of inlet flow. In this regard, the upstream backward-facing step as a misalignment induces the separation and attachment of the inlet flow sequentially, and these cause the boundary layer of the inlet flow to reform and become thinner locally. The upstream-step positively affects loss reduction in aerodynamics due to the thinner inlet boundary layer, which attenuates a horseshoe vortex ahead of the vane cascade despite the development of the additional vortices. And converging endwall results in an increase of the effect of the upstream misalignment in aerodynamics, since the inlet boundary layer becomes thinner near the vane's leading edge due to local flow acceleration caused by steep contraction of the converging endwall. These results show good correlation with many previous studies presented herein.\",","18505":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","18506":"\"description-provenance\": [","18507":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:00:38Z (GMT).

The intrusion of magma into country rock has been hypothesized to facilitate the release of carbon and sulfur bearing volatiles and has been proposed as one of mechanisms that drove these mass extinctions. In this study I examine a dike of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province and its interaction with adjacent sedimentary rocks in the Culpeper Basin of Virginia. Sampling was done at the 0.5 m scale along transects of sedimentary lithologies perpendicular to the ~170 m wide diabase intrusion. The observed mineralogical and geochemical changes in sedimentary rocks occur in a much narrower zone from the intrusion than predicted by the applied thermal model. Carbon isotopes of organic matter within the sedimentary rocks are enriched in 13C toward the intrusion indicating the generation of thermogenic methane within the first meter from the intrusion. Additionally, geochemical and petrologic textures suggest both the addition of magmatic sulfur into the country rock, shown through the isotopic signatures of sulfide minerals with mantle compositions. The  possible thermal break down of sedimentary pyrite is evidenced by highly negative isotopic composition of sulfide minerals and general lack of pyrite. I suggest that sedimentary pyrite initially reacted to pyrrhotite, which was then converted to chalcopyrite through reactions with copper in fluids derived from the magma. These reactions also allowed for the formation of magnetite, which is elevated near the dike-sedimentary contact and at the end of the transect. A simple illustrative model of a hypothesis of fluid flow along the bed is used to explain the observed isotopic signatures and mineralogical changes along the transect. This study highlights how models for volatile generation through magma-country rock interaction may have overestimated the volatile fluxes from these environments and the roles that heterogeneity of sedimentary rocks and kinetic factors may have in the variance in these fluxes.\",","18554":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","18555":"\"description-provenance\": [","18556":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:00:50Z (GMT).

In this thesis, we present a UKF formulation specially designed for a quadcopter carrying an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a downward-facing camera. The UKF fuses data from each of these sensors to track the position of the quadcopter over time. This work supports a number of similar efforts in the robotics and aerospace communities to navigate in GPS-denied environments with minimal hardware and minimal computational complexity. The software framework explored in this thesis provides a means for roboticists to easily implement similar UKF-based state estimators for a wide variety of systems, including surface vessels, undersea vehicles, and automobiles. We test the system's effectiveness by comparing its position estimates to those of a commercial motion capture system and then discuss possible applications.\",","18600":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","18601":"\"description-provenance\": [","18602":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:00:58Z (GMT).

AnimalsTwenty-two healthy dogs and 56 dogs with MMVD  MethodsAll dogs underwent conventional and 3D echocardiographic examinations. Measurements of 3DE RV function indices including RV end-diastolic volume (EDV), RV end-systolic volume (ESV), RV stroke volume (SV), and RV ejection fraction (EF) were recorded. Measurements of conventional indices of RV function were also obtained. RV EDV, ESV, and SV were indexed to bodyweight (BW) and analyzed using commercially available software.  ResultsThree-dimensional RV datasets could be acquired and analyzed in all dogs. Intra- and inter-observer coefficents of variation were > 20% for all 3D RV indices. Right ventricular EDV and ESV were decreased and RV EF was increased in dogs with advanced MMVD when compared to controls. Several conventional echocardiographic indices of RV function also differed between the control group and various MMVD groups.  ConclusionsReal-time 3DE RV assessment is feasible in normal dogs with acceptable intra- and inter-observer variability. Several 3DE indices of RV systolic function differ between dogs with advanced MMVD when compared to normal dogs. Further investigation is required to determine if these differences have clinical implications.\",","18645":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","18646":"\"description-provenance\": [","18647":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:01:16Z (GMT).

This paper addresses the management impacts of Rhododendron maximum removal in the riparian and upslope areas previously occupied by hemlock. This study measured the consequences macroinvertebrates faced due to riparian Rhododendron removal from 300 m reaches of two low order streams. Two additional low order streams served as reference sites for the experiment.  The stream macroinvertebrate communities were assessed using a before-after controlled impact model comparing communities between fall 2014 to those from fall 2015 and from spring 2015 to spring 2016. Macroinvertebrate collections consisted of 288 samples with a total of 61,056 individuals.   There was a significant increase in collector-gathers in both removal sites, mostly from increases in Ephemerellidae and Chironomidae. There was also a significant decrease in filter feeding organisms in the removal reaches.  Traits analysis also revealed that several traits that are shared by collector gathers also increased, e.g., short life cycles that are related to the increase in Chironomidae. Using Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and permutational MANOVA significant annual differences in macroinvertebrates were found in all of the stream reaches during both seasons. However, the trait based NMDS and permutational MANOVA found significant change only in one removal site between fall collections based on traits. These finding are consistent with findings from logging and other riparian removal projects; suggesting that the short-term impacts of selective Rhododendron removal on benthic macroinvertebrates are comparable to that of logging activity.\",","18689":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","18690":"\"description-provenance\": [","18691":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:01:30Z (GMT).

The problem has been studied for more than four decades and is known to be incredibly challenging. In fact, the complexity status of this problem remained open until recently when it was shown to be NP-Hard. We present a novel polynomial-time algorithm that computes a 16-approximation of the minimum weight triangulation---a constant that is significantly smaller than what has been previously known.   To construct our candidate solution, our algorithm uses grids to partition edges into levels by increasing weights, so that edges with similar weights appear in the same level. We incrementally triangulate the point set by constructing a growing partial triangulation for each level, introducing edges in increasing order of level. At each level, we use a variant of the ring heuristic followed by a greedy heuristic to add edges, finally resulting in a complete triangulation of the point set. In our analysis, we reduce the problem of comparing the weight of the candidate and the optimal solutions to a comparison between the cardinality of the two underlying graphs. We develop a new technique to compare the cardinality of planar straight-line graphs, and in combination with properties due to the imposed grid structure, we bound the approximation ratio.\",","18772":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","18773":"\"description-provenance\": [","18774":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:01:44Z (GMT).

I begin by first suggesting that the notion of beur as a category and label serves as a third space in the binary of French culture and Maghrebi culture. This third space is necessary as the children of Maghrebi immigrants in France find themselves in between each culture and the sphere of influence that follows. The term is then problematized. The theme of binaries and the third spaces that emerge because of the problematic nature of the binaries is recurring throughout my study. I explore what these third spaces are by examining four contemporary French novelsFa\u00efza Gu\u00e8ne\u2019s Kiffe kiffe demain and Un homme \u00e7a ne pleure pas, Ahmed Djouder\u2019s D\u00e9sint\u00e9gration, and Brahim Metiba\u2019s Ma m\u00e8re et moi. The characters in each of these works struggle with their identity as they forge their own third spaces as solutions to various binaries that they discover they cannot fit into. In my study, I demonstrate this in three realmsintegration and engaged citizenship; familial relationships, primarily parent-child relationships and the generational difference that further complicates pre-existing cultural difference; and gender roles. Each of the narratives and the main characters conveys the problematic nature of viewing French and Maghrebi culture in a binary. In my explication of the text, I argue that each narrative works towards the creation of a new third space in varying ways.\",","18900":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","18901":"\"description-provenance\": [","18902":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-07T08:02:10Z (GMT).

In 1879 Congress passed the Arrears Act, an immediately expensive pension bill that muddied the public's perception of veterans. Once considered heroes, the former soldiers of the Civil War became drains on the federal budget. At the same time, the membership of the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union veterans' organization, was increasing exponentially, making visible veterans commonplace. No longer was the Union veteran rare and honorable; by the 1880s the veteran was common and expensive. In response to the degradation of veteranhood, some former soldiers felt the blanket term 'veteran' needed to be reconsidered. These men went about creating the identity of \\"true\\"veteranhood in an attempt to reclaim the level of status attached to veterans immediately following the Civil War. Not all veterans were accepting of this \\"true\\" veteranhood, and actively fought back, forwarding instead a notion of inclusive veteranhood in which all former soldiers were represented. Neither side proved convincing, and the debate only ended in the early twentieth century as Union veterans died off and new veterans took their place. Through this debate, though, we can see the importance and complexity attached to identities, and the ways in which people actively reconsider themselves to cling to these identities in response to changes in their surroundings.\",","18992":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","18993":"\"description-provenance\": [","18994":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-08T08:00:24Z (GMT).

CVE is being criticized by various community leaders and members due to its inherent criminalizing nature as it is currently put into place by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). By exploring the various meanings of community in a multicultural community, various processes and practices can come to be analyzed as ways to prevent violent extremism without oversight from the DOJ and the DHS. Metro Detroit is a multicultural community that experiences statistically low levels of radicalization of community members who legitimize violent extremism. Even such cases can be delegitimized when considering the circumstances in which they exist. When examining the community cohesion that exists in Metro Detroit through various organizations, especially interfaith organizations, it becomes apparent that there is a strong attempt to create a cohesive community. The argument is not that community cohesion automatically leads to the absence of violent extremism, but that community cohesion builds relationships and practices so that potential causes for violent extremism can be addressed, lessened or diminished. It is suggested that the support of strengthening community cohesion in terms of CVE be dismantled from the DHS and the DOJ. Restructuring would best be supported as a joint effort between the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, all of which are better equipped to deal with the causes of violent extremism.\",","19023":"\"description-provenance\": [","19024":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-08T08:00:38Z (GMT).

Due to a noticeable increase in black lung among coal miners and new dust regulations, surfactants or wetting agents have been used to aid in dust suppression.  The surfactant facilitates the wetting process by lowering the surface tension and allowing the hydrophobic coal dust to come into contact with the water.   One of the most straightforward and effective benchtop tests is a simple wetting test.  Although there are variations of this type of test, principle and technique remain the same.  A known amount of dust was placed on the surface of a solution and the time it takes for all the dust to fall through the interface would be the wetting rate.  This investigation examined the specific density of the bulk dust and concentration of a surfactant in solution and their effects on the wetting rate.  It was found that both factors were significant in determining the wetting rate.  It was seen that the surfactant had a more significant effect on the dust which consisted mostly of coal particle when compared to a dust with a higher non-coal mineral content.  Additionally, full-scale tests were conducted to determine the effect of the surfactant at a constant concentration.  During the field implementation, the surfactant was pumped through the mines spray water to the cutter heads of the continuous miner.  A large number of uncontrollable variables present during the implementation, made determining the effects difficult, and the resulting impact from the surfactant inconclusive.  Further long-term testing would be needed while accounting for all of the identified variables.  Significantly higher concentration was however found when using the continuous personal dust monitor as opposed to the older personal dust samples when left in the same environment.  Additionally, a very significant drop in dust concentrations was observed when the miner operators were allowed to activate the scrubbers.\",","19117":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19118":"\"description-provenance\": [","19119":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-08T08:01:16Z (GMT).

Educational film producers relied on social science consultants for legitimacy and employed plots that addressed ordinary challenges of daily living encountered by teenagers. Shown in high school classrooms nationwide in the postwar years, these films advertised to young people the usefulness of a psychological understanding of personality adjustment. These films reflected the influence of ideas from both the progressive education movement inspired by John Dewey and the theories of mental hygiene from prewar psychologists. By viewing these films, students encountered advice about improving their individual productivity and they received guidance for developing skills needed in social settings. By parsing the cultural and intellectual messages embedded in these films and relating them to interwar and postwar developments, this thesis shows one way that social experts mobilized to shape the socialization of adolescents. Social guidance films intended to employ the specialized knowledge of the social sciences to promote the production of healthy and successful personalities.  More importantly, this thesis shows how social guidance films, in addressing ordinary teenage concerns, also addressed the political needs of American society at the dawn of the Cold War. The practical advice presented in these films showed adolescents how to tread the line between the preservation of individuality and commitment to the group\u2014the essential problem faced by post war political theorists.

How does The Back Lives Matter Movement use this information to create a solidarity movement against the oppression of African Americans? What does this mean going forward? Creating a synthesis of Mass Incarceration, the music of Kendrick Lamar, and The Black Lives Matter Movement, that overlaps and propels an intersection of culture and activism that inform one another. This all leads to the main takeaway of the thesis, that attempts to provide an interpretive understanding that pop culture, social media, and activism have created a different civil sphere, a Black public sphere that informs and educates through different avenues.

Both of these developments occurred in response to Iran's encounter with the European powers, specifically Russia and Great Britain.  Government-led reforms opened the possibility for the development of Iranian nationalism, as Iranian students were in England and brought back the first printing press with them to Iran in 1815.  The introduction of the printing press was significant to the development of the Iranian nation-state, as an increase in journals and periodicals introduced contemporary European political ideas to Iranians. This increased the calls to replicate the customs and norms of European society in Iran, ultimately leading to the Constitutional Revolution of 1906.  The Constitutional Revolution established a Parliament in Iran that was politically weak and held little power in the provinces outside of Tehran.  Tribal authority increased throughout Iran, and the Russians and British eventually occupied Iran from 1911 to 1917.  The establishment of Reza Shah's rule in 1921 introduced a new centralized Iranian state that was legitimated by the nation and established its rule over the tribes.  It is also during Reza Shah's rule that the conception of the Iranian nation begins to change.\",","19252":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","19253":"\"description-provenance\": [","19254":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-08T16:38:29Z (GMT).

This sharing will be enabled by use of geolocation database with supporting infrastructure termed as Spectrum Access System (SAS). Although using SAS for spectrum sharing has many pragmatic advantages, it also raises potentially serious operational security (OPSEC) issues.  In this thesis, we explore OPSEC, location privacy in particular, of incumbent radars in the 3.5 GHz band. First, we show that adversarial secondary users can easily infer the locations of incumbent radars by making seemingly innocuous queries to the database. Then, we propose several\tobfuscation techniques that can be implemented by the SAS for countering such inference attacks. We also investigate obfuscation techniques' efficacy in minimizing spectral efficiency loss while preserving incumbent privacy.  Recently, the 3GPP Rel.13 has specified a new standard to provide wide-area connectivity for IoT, termed as Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). NB-IoT achieves excellent coexistence with legacy mobile standards, and can be deployed in any of the 2G/3G/4G spectrum (450 MHz to 3.5 GHz). Recent industry efforts show deployment of IoT networks in unlicensed spectrum, including shared bands (e.g., 3.5 GHz band). However, operating NB-IoT systems in the 3.5 GHz band can result in significant BLER and coverage loss. In this thesis, we analyse results from extensive experimental studies on the coexistence of NB-IoT and radar systems, and demonstrate the coverage loss of NB-IoT in shared spectrum.\",","19296":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19297":"\"description-provenance\": [","19298":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-09T08:00:23Z (GMT).

Mobile people can be both pushed into a more settled existence by environmental or political forces, or pulled by new economic opportunities. While researchers have examined the causes and consequences of growing sedentarization, few contemporary studies have examined the patterns of settlement among mobile groups who are shifting to sedentary lifestyles and how these patterns may be related to socio-economic outcomes. This research examines settlement site selection by using GIS and remote sensing techniques to quantify settlement patterns in four Maasai villages in northern Tanzania, exploring the environmental and infrastructure correlates of settlement locations. A subset of these geographic variables is used with social survey data for 111 Maasai households in the study site to test the hypothesis that settlement location impacts livelihood strategies and economic outcomes by creating and constraining access to important resources and infrastructure. Landscape level evaluation of settlement pat-terns show that certain soil types limit occupation and the potential for agricultural expansion in 30% of the study area. Settlement density and existing agriculture are also clustered in certain parts of the landscape. The spatial models support the hypothesis that proximity to roads and village centers plays an important role in shaping overall settlement patterns. However, models that combine these factors with environmental and geophysical elements show improved explanatory performance, suggesting that competing factors are at play in influencing settlement patterns. Spatial models also indicate that agricultural development may be limiting land available for settlement in some parts of the study area. Results of the household level outcomes are more ambiguous, with few relationships between geographic variables and household livestock holdings, land under cultivation, annual income. Rather, these factors are influenced largely by demographic variables such as household size, age of the household head, and asset allocation. However, there appears to be less income diversity in households more distant from permanent water sources.\",","19340":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19341":"\"description-provenance\": [","19342":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-09T08:00:30Z (GMT).

Treatment prior to adulthood confers health benefits, but adolescent obesity rates have continually increased, reaching 20.6% in 2013-2014. Quality and quantity of dietary intake contribute to the development of obesity, but limitations of self-reported dietary intake are evident in overweight or obese adolescents, who frequently misreport nutrients of concern. Added sugar, sodium, and protein intake may indicate diet quality in this population. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommend decreasing consumption of added sugars, sodium, and processed protein due to their known contributions to overweight and obesity. Objective dietary intake assessment measures are necessary for investigating the association between dietary intake and health outcomes. Added sugar, sodium, and protein intake could be assessed objectively with a panel of urinary biomarkers. Prior research indicates the potential of these urinary biomarkers to reflect dietary intake, but to date, no controlled feeding study has been conducted in adolescents. Using a controlled feeding design, the current study aims to evaluate the validity of urinary sucrose, fructose, sodium, and nitrogen as objective indicators of dietary intake. It is hypothesized that urinary sucrose and fructose will reflect dietary added sugar intake, while urinary sodium and nitrogen will correspond to dietary sodium and protein intake, respectively, in a healthy adolescent population. These biomarkers, if valid, could be used in clinical and epidemiological research to improve understanding of the associations between dietary intake and health outcomes.\",","19384":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19385":"\"description-provenance\": [","19386":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-09T08:00:37Z (GMT).

Controlling heat release rate has applicability in limiting fire hazards as well as for designing fuels for optimal burning rate.  The burning rate of a structure is a function of the material properties as well as the airflow through it, which is dictated by the geometry.  This burning rate is generally  proportional to the porosity for objects in which the flow is limited by the path constriction.  The relations between porosity and burning rate are well studied for wood cribs, which are layers of wood sticks.  Crib and other objects with various geometric features were constructed of ABS plastic and coal powder using additive manufacturing processes. A cone calorimeter using oxygen calorimetry was used to measure the heat release rate of the crib specimens.  Within the flow limited burning regime, the burning rate of an object is proportional to the porosity factor. Porosity factors calculated from a 1-D theoretical burn rate model as well as from two empirical models were found to correlate the heat release rate results for the crib samples.  The heat release rate results of the complex geometries generally correlated to the same porosity factor; however, the model was modified to account for differences between regularly shaped cribs and objects with different sized flow areas.  Using the empirical models provides good correlation for the crib burning data and gives a clearer delineation between the flow-limited and surface area controlled regimes.\",","19430":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19431":"\"description-provenance\": [","19432":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-09T08:00:44Z (GMT).

Both of these approaches are inadequate in that they still a) prioritize the state/relate to the state/central authority, b) are Eurocentric (based on/dominated by European points of views), and c) do not adequately explain security collaborations in areas such as East Africa (EA). Therefore, this thesis develop a \\"responsive security community\\" approach which does not only ties top-down and ground-up approach, but it also advocates for development of strong states before the creation of a security community. This thesis argue that different states have their very different historical backgrounds and legacies. Hence, in order to have effective security community in EA there need be responsive, human security oriented states which embrace participation and inclusion in sub-national and national level. This would ensure the protection of the vital core of all their citizens' lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and human fulfillment. To discuss this responsive community approach, this thesis analyzes the theories of security community post WW II in conjunction with the development of the East African Community Security Protocol. This thesis also employs the theories of Participatory Budgeting (PB) and ground up approach as models for strengthening state and East African Civil Society Organization Forum (EACSOF). This thesis concludes that responsive security community in EA requires strong states which combine a focus on traditional notions of security with human/individual security.\",","19474":"\"description-degree\": \"MPIA\",","19475":"\"description-provenance\": [","19476":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-09T08:00:50Z (GMT).

The pedestrian lower-extremity represents the most frequently injured body region in car-to-pedestrian accidents. Several sub-system tests (head, upper and lower legs) were developed for pedestrian protection in Asia and Europe. However, with exception of a child headform impact test, all other subsystem tests are designed for prediction of adult pedestrian injuries. Due to differences in impact location and material properties, existing subsystem tests and dummies designed for adult pedestrian cannot be used for child pedestrian protection by simple scaling. Thus, the development of a computational child pedestrian model could be a better alternative that characterizes the whole-body response of vehicle-pedestrian interactions and assesses the pedestrian injuries.    Although several computational models for child pedestrian were developed in MADYMO/LS-DYNA, each has limitations. Children differ structurally from adults in several ways, which are critical to addressing before studying pediatric pedestrian protection. To aid in the development of accurate pediatric models, child pedestrian lower-extremity data presented in literature were first summarized. This review includes common pedestrian injuries, anatomy, anthropometry, structural and mechanical properties.     A Finite Element (FE) model corresponding to a six-year-old child pedestrian (GHBMC 6YO-PS) was developed in LS-DYNA. The model was obtained by linear scaling an existing adult model corresponding to 5th percentile female anthropometry to an average six-year-old child's overall anthropometry taken from literature, and then by morphing to the final target geometry. Initially, the material properties of an adult model were assigned to the child model, and then were updated based on pediatric data during the model validation. Since the lower extremity injuries are the most common injuries in pedestrian accidents, the model validation focus on the pelvis and lower extremity regions. Three-point bending test simulations were performed on the femur and tibia and the results were compared to Post-Mortem Human Subject (PMHS) data. The knee model was also simulated under valgus bending, the primary injury mechanism of the knee under lateral loading. Then, the whole pedestrian model was simulated in lateral impact simulation and its response was compared to PMHS data. Finally, the stability of the child model was tested in a series of pediatric Car-to-Pedestrian Collision (CPC) with pre-impact velocities ranging from 20 km/h up to 60 km/h. Overall, the lower extremity and pelvis models showed biofidelity against PMHS data in component simulations. The stiffness and fracture FE responses showed a good match to PMHS data reported in the literature. The knee model predicted common ligament injuries observed in PMHS tests and a lower bending stiffness than adult data. The pelvis impact force predicted by the child model showed a similar trend with PMHS test data as well. The whole pedestrian model was stable during CPC simulations. In addition, the most common injuries observed in pedestrian accidents including fractures of lower limb bones and ruptures of knee ligaments were predicted by the model. The child model was accepted to be used according to Euro-NCAP protocol, so it will be used by safety researchers in the design of front ends of new vehicles in order to increase pedestrian protection of children.\",","19563":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19564":"\"description-provenance\": [","19565":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-10T08:00:36Z (GMT).

I ultimately argue that action-guiding theories of justice that evaluate worlds with systematic oppression must represent features of injustice.

Over the next couple decades, these descriptive pieces became more prescriptive, instructing women how to throw a \\"proper\\" Halloween party; what food to serve, games to play, and atmosphere to evoke.

Finally, how did this particular celebration of Halloween reflect the interplay of certain values among these celebrants through literature, imagery, and ephemera?

However, optimal mission design depends on minimizing payload size and power. This thesis investigates the GLO (GFCR (Gas Filter Correlation Radiometry) Limb Occultation) prototype, a new small-form-factor design that enables sub-kilometer resolution of the vertical profile of atmospheric trace species to determine radiative influences. This technology improves SWAP (Size, Weight, And Power) over heritage SOFIE and HALOE instruments and provides a cost-effective alternative for solar occultation limb monitoring.  A python script was developed to analyze solar intensity through GLO telescope channels. Non-uniform aerosol images used a peak intensity algorithm compared to the edge detection function designed for GFCR channels. Scaling corrections were made for beam splitter inaccuracy and SNR was characterized for frame collection. Different cameras were tested to weigh accuracy versus cost of a camera baffle. Using the Langley plot method, solar intensity versus changes in the solar zenith angle were measured for extrapolation of optical depths. AERONET, a network of ground-based sun photometers measuring atmospheric aerosols, was used for aerosol optical depth validation. Spectral Calculator transmission data allowed for GFCR vacuum channel comparison, gas cell spectral analysis, and gas cell to vacuum channel optical depth examination. Ground testing provided promising results with the low-cost prototype.  It will be further evaluated through a balloon flight demonstration using a flight-ready GLO instrument. Additionally, analysis for the DUSTIE mission is planned and simulated using STK and Matlab. This includes CubeSat bus selection, orbit analysis for occultation occurrences, power budgeting, and communication capabilities.\",","19791":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19792":"\"description-provenance\": [","19793":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-10T08:01:38Z (GMT).

This has pronounced the necessity to scale the device's supply voltage (VDD) in to order to maintain low-power device operation. However, the scaling of VDD can degrade drive current significantly due to the low carrier mobility of Si. To overcome the key challenges of dimensional and voltage scaling required for low-power electronic operation without degradation of device characteristics, the adoption of alternate channel materials with low bandgap with superior transport properties will play a crucial role to improve the computation ability of the standard integrated circuit (IC). The requirement of high-mobility channel materials allows the industry to harness the potential of III-V semiconductors and germanium. However, the adoption of such high mobility materials as bulk substrates remains cost-prohibitive even today. Hence, another key challenge lies in the heterogeneous integration of epitaxial high-mobility channel materials on the established cost-effective Si platform. Furthermore, dimensional scaling of the device has led to a change in architecture from the conventional planar MOSFET to be modified to a 3-D Tri-gate architecture which provides fully depleted characteristics by increasing the inversion layer area and hence, providing superior electrostatic control of the device channel to address short channel effects such as subthreshold slope (SS) and drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL). The Tri-gate configuration provides a steeper SS effectively reducing leakage current (IOFF), thereby decreasing dynamic power consumption and increasing device performance. Recently, Tantalum silicate (TaSiOx) a high-k dielectric has been shown to exhibit superior interfacial quality on multiple III-V materials. However, there is still ambiguity as to the potential of short-channel devices incorporating alternate channel (III-V) materials which is the basis of this research, to demonstrate the feasibility of future high-mobility n-channel InGaAs material integration on Si for high- speed, low-power, high performance CMOS logic applications.\",","19881":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19882":"\"description-provenance\": [","19883":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-13T08:00:28Z (GMT).

Total ankle replacement is a viable surgical option for treating end-stage ankle arthritis, but few have studied its effects on balance over time. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of a single-marker method of tracking center of mass, evaluate center of pressure measurements in total ankle replacement patients, and analyze lower extremity joint contributions over a two-year recovery period. Subjects stood on two force platforms for ten seconds in different conditions, and relevant variables were calculated from the force platform and 3D motion capture data. Results showed that increasing recovery time restored partial symmetry between the surgical and non-surgical limbs in ground reaction force, ankle range of motion, and ankle and hip moment contribution in static balance tasks. Furthermore, the ankle and hip may have different roles in postural stability. The results of the studies suggest that total ankle replacement is an effective treatment for end-stage ankle arthritis in terms of restoring postural stability. While patients may not have returned to the level of healthy control subjects, they are more functional and more stable after a two-year recovery period. While further work is needed, the results are encouraging for the outlook of ankle arthritis patients who may need total ankle replacement surgery.\",","19927":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","19928":"\"description-provenance\": [","19929":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-13T08:00:35Z (GMT).

We leverage this observation to construct a dataset for Question Relevance Prediction and Explanation (QRPE) by searching for false premises.

In order to adopt a more sustainable solution, much research is being applied to self-powered sensing, implementing solutions which harvest wasted ambient energy sources to power these dedicated sensors. The adoption of not only wireless sensor nodes, but also self-powered capabilities in the nuclear energy process is critical as it can address issues in the overall safety and longevity of nuclear power. The removal of wires for data and power transmission can greatly reduce the cost of both installation and upkeep of power plants, while self-powered capabilities can further reduce effort and money spent in replacing batteries, and importantly may enable sensors to work even in losses to power across the plant, increasing plant safety. This thesis outlines three harvesting opportunities in the nuclear energy process fromthermal, vibration, and radiation sources in the main structure of the power plant, and from thermal and radiation energy from spent fuel in dry cask storage. Thermal energy harvesters for the primary and secondary coolant loops are outlined, and experimental analysis done on their longevity in high-radiation environments is discussed. A vibrational energy harvester for large rotating plant machine vibration is designed, prototyped, and tested, and a model is produced to describe its motion and energy output. Finally, an introduction to the design of a gamma radiation and thermal energy harvester for spent nuclear fuel canisters is discussed, and further research steps are suggested.\",","20014":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20015":"\"description-provenance\": [","20016":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-13T08:00:51Z (GMT).

In this pursuit, III-V compound semiconductor based solar cells have steadily shown performance improvement at approximately 1% (absolute) increase per year, with a recent record efficiency of 46% under concentrator and 32% under AM0. However, the expensive cost has made it challenging for III-V solar cells to compete with the mainstream Silicon (Si) technology. Novel approaches to lower down the cost per watt for III-V solar cells will position them to be among the key contenders in the renewable energy sector. Integration of such high-efficiency III-V multijunction solar cells on significantly cheaper and large area Si substrate has the potential to address the future LCOE roadmaps by unifying the high-efficiency merits of III-V materials with low-cost and abundance of Si. However, the 4% lattice mismatch, thermal mismatch, polar on non-polar epitaxy makes the direct growth of GaAs on Si challenging, rendering the metamorphic cell sensitive to dislocations.  The focus of this dissertation is to investigate heterogeneously integrated 1J GaAs solar cells on Si substrate using germanium (Ge) as an intermediate buffer layer that will address mitigation of defects and dislocations between GaAs active cell structure and Ge \u201cvirtual\u201d substrate on Si. The all-epitaxial molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown thin (<1 \u03bcm) hybrid GaAs/Ge \u201cvirtual\u201d buffer approach provided 1J GaAs cell efficiency of ~10% on Si, as compared with cell structures with thick 3 \u03bcm GaAs buffers. Solar cell results were further corroborated with material analysis to provide a clear path for the reduction of performance limiting dislocations. The thin \u201cGe-on-Si\u201d virtual buffer was then investigated comprehensively to understand the impact of the heterostructure on device performance. The growth, structural, morphological, and electrical transport properties of epitaxial thin-film Ge, grown by solid source MBE on Si using a two-step growth process, were investigated. High-resolution x-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated ~0.10% tensile strained Ge epilayer, owing to the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between Ge and Si, and negligible epilayer lattice tilt due to misfit dislocations at the Ge/Si heterointerface. Micro-Raman spectroscopic analysis further corroborated the strain-state of the Ge thin-film on Si. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of a 90\u00b0 Lomer dislocation network at the Ge/Si heterointerface, suggesting the rapid and complete relaxation of the Ge epilayer during growth. Atomic force micrographs exhibited smooth surface morphologies with surface roughness < 2 nm. Hall mobility measurements, performed within a temperature range of 77 K to 315 K, and the modelling thereof indicated that ionized impurity scattering limited carrier mobility in the thin Ge epilayer. Additionally, capacitance- and conductance-voltage measurements were performed after fabricating the metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors (MOS-Cs) in order to determine the effect of epilayer dislocation density on interfacial defect states (Dit), bulk trap density, and the energy distribution of Dit as a function of temperature for electronic device applications. Deep level transient spectroscopy was used to identify the location (within the Ge bandgap) of electrically active trap levels; however, no significant trap levels were detected. Finally, the extracted Dit values were benchmarked against previously reported Dit data for Ge MOS devices, as a function of threading dislocation density within the Ge layer. The results obtained in this work were found to be comparable with other Ge MOS devices integrated on Si via alternative buffer schemes. The understanding gained from this comprehensive study of Ge-on-Si will help optimize the 1J GaAs on Si via thin Ge buffer approach, to enable a future of high efficiency low cost solar cells for terrestrial applications.\",","20063":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"The global energy landscape is projected to change remarkably in the coming decades with dwindling carbon based resource reserves and escalating energy demands, necessitating large-scale adoption of cleaner alternatives, such as solar energy. However, for widespread commercial and domestic adoption of photovoltaics, the cost of solar generated electricity must become competitive with non-renewable resources such as oil or coal. Thus, achieving high efficiency solar cells and driving down cell costs are key research objectives of the photovoltaic (PV) community in order to become more self-sufficient in the energy sector. In this pursuit, III-V compound semiconductor-based solar cells have steadily outperformed all other PV technologies, but cost-prohibitive for terrestrial deployment. Si is the undisputed standard in the PV industry; thus, to make a significant step forward in the pursuit of high efficiency solar cells, a promising approach will be to integrate the superior properties of compound semiconductors with the mature technology of Si. This research systematically investigates the integration of high efficiency III-V cells with low cost, abundant Si substrates via a germanium (Ge) layer to unify the performance merits of III-V cells with the cost benefits and superior mechanical and thermal properties of Si. Concurrently, Ge has also emerged as a strong candidate to boost transistor performance at low operating voltages, primarily owing to its superior carrier mobility and ease of integration into mainstream Si process flow. This research further delves into the structural and electrical properties of the Ge on Si structure. Overall, this research demonstrates the feasibility of the use of Ge directly integrated on Si for high efficiency solar cells and low-power electronic devices.\",","20064":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20065":"\"description-provenance\": [","20066":"\"Authorgaheli3@vt.edu\",","20067":"\"Provide open and immediate access to the ETD\",","20068":"\"I hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and submitted with my ETD a   \t\t\t\twritten permission statement from the ower(s) of each third part copyrighted matter to be included   \t\t\t\tin my thesis or dissertation, allowing distribution as specified above.  \t\t\t\t I certify that the version I submitted is the same as that approved by my advisory committee.\",","20069":"\"Submitted by Aheli Ghosh (gaheli3@vt.edu) on 2017-06-13T15:42:27Z No. of bitstreams3 license_rdf1031 bytes, checksum72519bed840f81617dda6654b015f0a1 (MD5) Ghosh_A_T_2017.pdf6324872 bytes, checksumf831b1daafcb01adbd30263e16d165b5 (MD5) Ghosh_A_IEEE_approval_2017.pdf132284 bytes, checksumfbf831e8a0b9c6ffc15e6020698ebda7 (MD5)\",","20070":"\"Approved for entry into archive by Priscilla Wright (pkwright@vt.edu) on 2017-06-13T15:54:26Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams3 license_rdf1031 bytes, checksum72519bed840f81617dda6654b015f0a1 (MD5) Ghosh_A_T_2017.pdf6324872 bytes, checksumf831b1daafcb01adbd30263e16d165b5 (MD5) Ghosh_A_IEEE_approval_2017.pdf132284 bytes, checksumfbf831e8a0b9c6ffc15e6020698ebda7 (MD5)\",","20071":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-13T16:41:29Z (GMT).

This is because for many people, the sounds produced by these vehicles are found to be extremely annoying.  The focus of this thesis is to recreate the time-varying rotorcraft noise at the source for a single emission angle.  Then, through interpolation between emission angles, produce a simulated flyover at the source that can then be propagated to a receiver.   This will allow for the creation of a simulated flyover without the need of having to use a physical aircraft, or pre-existing data from some type of data collection means, such as a microphone array.  The current methods are limited to a predefined length of data in order to synthesize signals.  It has been documented that synthesizing flyover noise, from direct use of physical flyover recordings through an empirical approach, yields a high fidelity signal, as long as both unmodulated and modulated components are present.  In order to extend these signals indefinitely, models for the amplitude and phase modulation must be developed.  A band-limited random process will be explored for both the amplitude and phase modulations.  An overlap-add technique, as well as a randomization technique and a modified phase modulation signal, defined as the \\"residual\\", will also be attempted in order to model the phase modulation.  The results from this work have successfully found a means in which to produce a viable model of the amplitude modulation.  Further investigation is still required in order to produce a model of the phase modulation which results in a high-fidelity model that can be extended indefinitely.\",","20117":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20118":"\"description-provenance\": [","20119":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-14T08:00:45Z (GMT).

While the measure is intended to improve access to weight-loss resources for millions of Americans affected, it may not achieve its intended effect in part because of the inability of disadvantaged populations for whom the burden of obesity is the greatest to access ACA-supported services. The objectives of this study were to identify the characteristics that, paired with an evidence-based weight-loss intervention, will have the highest potential reach while achieving a clinically meaningful weight loss, and whether likely participation differs by gender, race, ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Using characteristics from the most effective adult weight-loss studies that use technology to expand reach, three alternative interventions were examined. Findings show that, while the majority of participants favor the traditional ACA face-to-face model, a program delivered completely online may appeal to racial and ethnic minority groups, which were more likely to choose alternative program structures.

Then, this technique is applied to determine the bubble distance along the optical path based on the blurriness or intensity gradient information of the bubble. Using the image processing algorithm, images captured in three different experiments are analyzed to develop a correlation between the bubble distance and its intensity gradient. The suggested models to predict the bubble depth are also developed based on the measurement data and evaluated with the measured data. When the intensity gradient of the bubble is lower or when a bubble is located farther from the focal plane, the model can predict the distance more accurately. However, the models show larger absolute and relative error when the bubble is near the focal plane. To improve the prediction in that region, another model should be considered.

With the development of the technology, the imaging technique can provide better spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image processing speed has improved greatly. In this study, the imaging and defocusing techniques are combined and used to extract bubble depth information. An image processing algorithm has been developed to process bubble images captured by high speed cameras. By measuring the blurriness or intensity gradient information of the bubble, the bubble distance along the optical path is determined.

After reviewing the feasibility of utilizing electrospray as a scalable thin film deposition technique as well as the advantages and limitations of prior MES emitters, we present a design rationale for MES suitable for highly conductive and corrosive fluids. Then we customized a 1064nm fiber laser micromachining system to precisely and rapidly machine silicone sheet and silicon wafers. Laser energy and path are judicially chosen to create clean and round micro posts that form the external structure of the nozzles. For MES with low flow rate per nozzle, it is of vital importance to evenly distribute the liquid into each nozzle on the entire MES array by controlling the pressure drop inside each fluid flow channel. To this end, we modeled the dimension of microfluidic channels that introduce flow impedance overwhelming surface tension at the nozzle tip. We presented laser microfabrication techniques for fabricating two typical types of microfluidic channelsthe through-hole array on conductive silicone sheets and the in-plane microfluidic channel on silicon wafers. Next, we developed a convenient assemble process for the integration of three layers (distributor layer, extractor layer, and collector layer) of the MES emitter. The uniformity of the flow rate among nozzles on MES emitters was investigated by observing the overall spray profiles and measuring the diameter of each jet. The results suggest that the silicone-based MES emitters are feasible for spraying highly conductive and corrosive liquids. The MES emitter developed in this thesis may become a promising tool in the scalable manufacturing of thin film perovskite solar cells.\",","20382":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20383":"\"description-provenance\": [","20384":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-15T08:00:16Z (GMT).

We describe a mechanism that authenticates all major components of PCB as part of attesting the PCB. Our authentication protocol constructs the fingerprint of PCB by extracting hardware fingerprint from the components on PCB and cryptographically combining the fingerprints. Fingerprints from each component on PCB are developed using Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF).   In this thesis, we present a PUF based authentication protocol for remote integrity checking using multiple PUF component level identifiers. We address the design on 3 different abstraction levels. 1)Hardware Level, 2)Hardware Integration level, 3)Protocol level. On the hardware level, we propose an approach to develop PUF from flash memory component on the device. At the hardware Integration level, we discuss a hardware solution for implementing a trustworthy PUF based authentication.

DDC transceivers have a simple structure with fewer analog components and offer low-cost, flexible and multi-standard solutions. However, DDC transceivers have certain circuit impairments affecting their performance in wide-band, high data rate and multi-user systems.  IQ imbalance is one of the problems of DDC transceivers that limits their image rejection capabilities. Compensation techniques for frequency independent IQI arising due to gain and phase mismatches of the mixers in the I/Q paths of the transceiver have been widely discussed in the literature. However for wideband multi-channel transceivers, it is becoming increasingly important to address frequency dependent IQI arising due to mismatches in the analog I/Q lowpass filters.  A hardware-efficient and standard independent digital estimation and compensation technique for frequency dependent IQI is introduced which is also capable of tracking time-varying IQI changes. The technique is blind and adaptive in nature, based on the second order statistical properties of complex random signals such as properness/circularity.  A detailed performance analysis of the introduced technique is executed through computer simulations for various real-time operating scenarios. A novel technique for finding the optimal number of taps required for the adaptive IQI compensation filter is proposed and the performance of this technique is validated. In addition, a metric for the measure of properness is developed and used for error power and step size analysis.\",","20462":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20463":"\"description-provenance\": [","20464":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-15T08:00:39Z (GMT).

OpenACC is a directive-based programming model that, unlike low-level programming models, abstracts the details of implementation on the GPU. Although OpenACC generally limits the performance of the GPU, this model significantly reduces the work required to port an existing code to any accelerator platform, including GPUs.  The purpose of this research is twofoldto investigate the effectiveness of OpenACC in developing a portable and maintainable GPU-accelerated code, and to determine the capability of OpenACC to accelerate large, complex programs on the GPU. In both of these studies, the OpenACC implementation is optimized and extended to a multi-GPU implementation while maintaining a unified code base. OpenACC is shown as a viable option for GPU computing with CFD problems.  In the first study, a CFD code that solves incompressible cavity flows is accelerated using OpenACC. Overlapping communication with computation improves performance for the multi-GPU implementation by up to 21%, achieving up to 400 times faster performance than a single CPU and 99% weak scalability efficiency with 32 GPUs.   The second study ports the execution of a more complex CFD research code to the GPU using OpenACC. Challenges using OpenACC with modern Fortran are discussed. Three test cases are used to evaluate performance and scalability. The multi-GPU performance using 27 GPUs is up to 100 times faster than a single CPU and maintains a weak scalability efficiency of 95%.\",","20506":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20507":"\"description-provenance\": [","20508":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-15T08:00:47Z (GMT).

This study uses the USDA-ERS China Model and the Country-Commodity Linked System (CCLS) to simulate the impacts on U.S. sorghum exports and the reduction of sorghum's global price, global production, and global trade volumes. The simulations are based on three scenariosif China's sorghum import volume decreased by 50% from USDA-ERS's baseline projection, if China's sorghum import volume decreased by 35% each year from the previous year, and if China's sorghum import volume decreased by 70% from USDA-ERS's baseline projection in year one and by 90% from USDA-ERS's baseline projection in subsequent years.  The modeling system is a large scale multi-country and multi-commodity partial equilibrium dynamic simulation model which solves for global prices and trade using individual country models. Policy instruments are applied to the China model and solved globally. The USDA-ERS China Model and the CCLS, used to project Chinese and global sorghum trends, includes the following policy instrumentstariffs, quotas, tariff rate quotas, export tax, direct payments, input subsidies, and procurement policies. This model simulates projections using price and income elasticities and assumed values for exogenous variables such as income and population growth. This model also incorporates behavior of state trading enterprises and WTO commitments into imported and exported equations for sorghum.\",","20595":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20596":"\"description-provenance\": [","20597":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-16T08:00:21Z (GMT).

Furthermore, despite a small number of observations, there is a strong indication of increased risk for narcoleptic drivers. The findings confirmed results from simulator and epidemiological studies that the driving risk increases amongst people with certain types of sleep disorders. However, this study did not yield evidence in naturalistic driving settings to confirm significantly increased driving risk associated with migraine in prior research. The inconsistency may be an indication that the significant decline in cognitive performance among drivers with sleep disorders observed in laboratory settings may not nessarily translate to an increase in actual driving risk. Further research is necessary to define how to incentivize drivers with specific sleep disorders to balance road safety and personal mobility.\",","20641":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20642":"\"description-provenance\": [","20643":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-16T08:00:28Z (GMT).

Through a systematic descriptive analysis of communication strategies, a case analysis of Bon App\u00e9tit magazine is the focus of this thesis. Guided by the uses and gratifications theoretical perspective and informed by a systematic descriptive analysis, this thesis offers a rich examination of the Bon App\u00e9tit magazine brand and the ways the brand has been extended in the evolving digital media environment. The unique approach implemented in this thesis provides the opportunity to observe uses and gratifications from the organization's standpoint, instead of the consumer's. This unique approach was designed to reveal how Bon App\u00e9tit is attempting to fulfill consumer needs and gratifications through the digital media brand extensions, specifically its website, social media, and podcast. Analysis of Bon App\u00e9tit brand extensions indicate that six of Parham Santana's ten brand extension strategies are being implemented by Bon App\u00e9tit, including shift the form, transfer a component, transfer a benefit, leverage a special expertise, leverage your consumer base, and leverage a lifestyle. Another significant finding indicates that Bon App\u00e9tit implemented communication strategies centered on accessibility and convenience, surveillance, diversion, and interaction gratifications on its digital media platforms. Findings from this study suggest that future researchers would benefit from adding convenience and accessibility as gratifications considered in the uses and gratifications theoretical approach when researching digital media.  Additionally, replication of the systematic method in this thesis, especially if applied to other magazine brands, could help reveal the types of brand extensions at play in digital platforms and whether other magazines use similar strategies to build and maintain relationships with consumers.\",","20687":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","20688":"\"description-provenance\": [","20689":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-17T08:00:18Z (GMT).

Beyond the facade, one discovers the unique story of each parcel through the transformations that its residents have enacted over many centuries in order to accommodate greater density and the evolution of family structures. One might even find a record of building periods following a hurricane, for example, inscribed by hand on a column in the shared patio for the collective memory of current and future tenants. These transformations are almost all realized through self-effort construction and are a community-building exercise. Unfortunately, the paradox that accompanies the informal typologies to construct additional housing is destructive more often than not. The additions to and division of the highly articulated residential architecture in Havana have a pervasive impact on the building structure and exacerbates the decay of the built environment. The formal typologies established to define thresholds and transition between public and private spaces are as much a part of the social landscape as the informal insertions. Housing la Habana Vieja calls for a reconciliation of the architectural heritage with contemporary building attitudes in its design for multi-family housing in the historic city center of Cuba.  This project addresses the housing crisis in Havana and proposes a resolution that is suited to the \\"economy of means, both material and aesthetic,\\"to appropriate the design philosophy of Cuban-American architect Belmont Freeman. The context investigates the underpinnings of housing attitudes by identifying milestones and gaining perspective from dialogue with the residents of la Habana Vieja. Documenting the formal and informal typologies allowed for a comparison of both their spatial implications and their performance, or function. The design proposal explores the intersection of these typologies to manifest the social behaviors and cultural values in the definition of shared and private space. The formal typologies engage the transitional qualities of space by layering building elements as thresholds to private realms. The informal typologies are engaged in the construction of habitable space by activating the immediate built environment through the addition and multiplication of planes. To design at the corner of the past and present is to preserve the vernacular and brandish the opportunities that the future holds for Housing la Habana Vieja.\",","20775":"\"description-degree\": \"MARCH\",","20776":"\"description-provenance\": [","20777":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-17T08:00:52Z (GMT).

As networks grow larger and more complex, two-dimensional visualizations become more convoluted, potentially compromising user situational awareness of cyber threats. To combat this problem, augmented reality (AR) can be employed to visualize data within a cyber-physical context to restore user perception and improve comprehension; thereby, enhancing cyber situational awareness. Multiple generations of prototypes, known collectively as Mobile Augmented Reality for Cyber Security, or MARCS, were developed to study the impact of AR on cyber situational awareness. First generation prototypes were subjected to a formative pilot study of 44 participants, to generate user-centric performance data and feedback, which motivated the design and development of second generation prototypes and provided initial insight into the potentially beneficial impact of AR on cyber situational awareness. Second generation prototypes were subjected to a summative secondary study by 50 participants, to compare the impact of AR and non-AR visualizations on cyber situational awareness. Results of the secondary study suggest that employing AR to visualize cyber threats in a cyber-physical context collectively improves user threat perception and comprehension, indicating that, in some cases, AR security visualizations improve user cyber situational awareness over non-AR security visualizations.\",","20863":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20864":"\"description-provenance\": [","20865":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-20T08:00:34Z (GMT).

As these platforms evolve, brands have had to adapt in order to use the available social media platforms to gain visibility in the millennial audience. Recently brands have turned to online 'celebrities' known as a social media influencer (SMI) to distribute information and influence consumers' product perceptions. This specifically has become a common tactic in communication and marketing efforts with the fashion and beauty industry. Ample research is available on the effects of celebrity endorsements but currently there is a gap in research pertaining to the consumer's perspective towards SMIs and SMIs effects on consumers. The online experiment completed in this thesis addressed how promotion of a product by a SMI affects perceptions of consumers on Instagram by measuring social comparison and self-congruity. This is accomplished by comparing participant's product perception to promotional posts on Instagram by a SMI, brand, and unbranded retail source. A three-condition experiment (SMI, Brand, Control) compared effects of product perception, social comparison, and self-congruity. A questionnaire consisting of 48 questions pertaining to SMI, self-congruity, social comparison, and product perception was completed by 151 participants. Significant relationships were found between the source of the promotional post (SMI, Brand, Control) and product perception. There was also a correlation between self-congruity and social comparison towards the SMI as well as product perception. Results suggest that the post source influences product perception. Results also indicate consumers' perception of the SMI effects product perception. These results provide practical implications for communication practioners who utilize social media.  The rapid growth of visual microblogging platforms such as Instagram, is creating new opportunities for organizations to communicate with stakeholders. Brands have used social media platforms in order to gain visibility in the college age audience. Currently there is a gap in research pertaining to SMI and their effects on consumers. This online experiment will address how promotion of a product by an SMI affects perceptions of consumers on Instagram through social comparison and self-congruity theory by comparing responses to a product promoted by an SMI to the same product promoted by the promoted by the brand and to an unbranded retail source. A questionnaire consisting 34 of questions pertaining to SMI, self-congruity, and social comparison will be asked to 180-240 participants. The participants will be randomly assigned one of nine Instagram posts to accomplish stimulus sampling across the three conditionsthree from SMI, three from brands, and three from an unbranded retail source\",","20905":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","20906":"\"description-provenance\": [","20907":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-20T08:00:41Z (GMT).

Automotive manufacturers are responding by designing more sustainable forms of transportation through a variety of efforts, including increased vehicle efficiency and the electrification of vehicle powertrains (plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV)). An additional method for reducing the environmental impact of personal transport is eco-routing, a methodology which selects routes on the basis of energy consumption.  Standard navigation systems offer route alternatives between a user clarified origin and destination when there are multiple paths available. These alternatives are commonly weighted on the basis of minimizing either total travel time (TTT) or trip distance. Eco-routing offers an alternative criterion \ufffd\ufffd\\" minimizing route energy consumption. Calculation of the energy consumption of a route necessitates the creation of a velocity profile which models how the route will be driven and a powertrain model which relates energy consumption to the constructed velocity profile. Existing research efforts related to both of these aspects typically require complex analysis and proprietary vehicle properties.  A new approach to weighting the energy consumption of different routes is presented within this paper. The process of synthesizing velocity profiles is an improvement upon simpler models while requiring fewer variables as compared to more complex models. A single input, the maximum acceleration, is required to tune driver aggressiveness throughout an entire route. Additionally, powertrain results are simplified through the application of a new parameter, predictive terminal energy. The parameter uses only glider properties as inputs, as compared to dedicated powertrain models which use proprietary vehicle information as inputs which are not readily available from manufacturers. Application of this research reduces computation time and increases the number of vehicles for which this analysis can be applied. An example routing scenario is presented, demonstrating the capability of the velocity synthesis and predictive terminal energy methodologies.\",","20989":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","20990":"\"description-provenance\": [","20991":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-20T08:00:56Z (GMT).

The first section of this thesis focuses on Donald Trump and the various rhetorical spaces he uses to reach his supporters through affectual means. Next, I will apply affect theory to Trump\u2019s political rhetoric in order to illustrate how affect is intrinsic to his rhetoric and how he communicates to his audience. I find that utilizing texts by cultural rhetoric critics, namely those which discuss affect theory and the culture of emotion such as Sara Ahmed\u2019s The Cultural Politics of Emotion, and culture and rhetorical spaces in Julie Lindquist\u2019s A Place to StandPolitics and Persuasion in a Working Class Bar, allows us to better understand the underlying cultural impetuses which created the conditions for Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. In the third section, I examine how these theoretical frameworks provide an understanding of how fake news contributed to the current American climate of a post-truth media culture. And in the final section, I explore how satirical rhetoric is employed both as a defense against and as a rhetorical utility for Donald Trump, namely in his use of carnivalesque techniques and rhetoric to appeal to his voter\u2019s sense of rebellion against and cynicism toward the political establishment. In doing so, I argue that Trump\u2019s use of affect, particularly in his targeted approach to appeal to his base\u2019s existential, socio-economic, and racial fears, was essential to his success in the 2016 Presidential election.\",","21034":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","21035":"\"description-provenance\": [","21036":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-20T08:01:19Z (GMT).

It is up to the producer to ensure that the calves develop properly to meet their expected needs on the farm. While there are guidelines from the NRC in place, there is a substantial range in the amount of protein and fat that a calf can be fed. This physiological state can be reflected in the proteins produced in tissues, the expression of gene regulatory pathways, or even the microbes present in the gut. The purpose of this study was to examine how an increase in dietary energy in milk replacer of pre-weaned Holstein heifers impacts the microbial profile of the rumen as well as the transcriptome in tissues related to growth and metabolism. Our hypothesis was that pre-weaned Holstein heifers on milk replacer diets with lower dietary energy will have a different rumen microbiome composition and a different transcriptome in growth related tissues.  Holstein heifer calves (n = 36) were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 milk replacer dietsrestricted (R; 20.9% CP, 19.8% Fat; n = 18) or enhanced (E; 28.9% CP, 26.2% Fat; n = 18). Calves were euthanized and rumen fluid was collected at pre-weaning (8 wks; n = 6) or post-weaning (10 wks; n = 6). Liver (L), adipose (A), and longissimus dorsi (LD) tissues were collected at pre-weaning (8 wks; n = 12). Average daily gain (ADG) and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) were calculated for each calf. Analysis of ADG and G:F was performed using a PROC GLM in SAS with diet as the main effect; E calves had increased ADG and G:F compared to R calves.  For rumen samples, libraries were constructed from extracted DNA and DNASeq was conducted using a paired-end analysis at 100 bp using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering analysis was conducted using the 16s rRNA Greengenes reference. A PERMANOVA analysis was conducted in R to determine OTU populations for age and treatment. There was no difference in microbiome composition between pre-weaning and post-weaning calves (P = 0.761). Microbiome composition differed between E and R calves (P < 0.001). Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes represented the most abundant phyla for both E and R calves. Enhanced calves had 49.4% (5141 reads) Bacteriodetes and 36.4% (3789 reads) Firmicutes; whereas, R calves had 31.6% (2491 reads) Bacteriodetes and 41.1% (3236 reads) Firmicutes. For L, A, and LD samples, libraries were constructed from extracted RNA for RNA-Seq analyses. RNA-Seq analysis was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench and the Robinson and Smith Exact Test was used to identify differentially expressed genes between diets. There were 238 differentially expressed genes in A, 227 in LD, and 40 in L. Of the differentially expressed genes, 10 appeared in at least 2 tissues. PANTHER was used to identify functional categories of differentially expressed genes. The majority of genes were associated with metabolic processes (A = 112, 26.7%; L = 16, 32.0%; LD = 81, 34.0%) or cellular processes (A = 93, 22.1%; L = 13, 26.0%; LD = 73, 30.7%). In E calves, upregulated genes included those regulating NADH dehydrogenation (LD = 17, A = 5; i.e. ND1, ND4), gluconeogenesis (LD = 2, A = 6; i.e. ALDOB, PCK2), and cell proliferation (LD = 2, A = 3; i.e. GADD45A, CDKN1A). There was a difference in both the transcriptome and rumen microbiome of calves fed differing levels of dietary energy. The calves on the R diet had a rumen microbial composition more similar to a younger calf, while the composition of E calves was more similar to a mature calf.

The eight bolt extended stiffened connection is the strongest of the three configurations, but it can only develop approximately 30 percent of currently available hot-rolled beam sections. The strength of this configuration is limited by bolt strength. There is a need for a stronger end-plate moment connection, hence the reason for the development and validation of a twelve bolt configuration. Equations were developed for the design procedure using various analytical methods, which included yield line analysis and an effective tee stub model. An experimental program was conducted, which consisted of the full-scale cyclic testing of four end-plate moment connections. The intention of the testing was to develop and validate the design procedure, and prequalify a new twelve bolt configuration. A displacement-controlled loading protocol was applied according to AISC 341-10. The experimental results showed that the model for thick end-plate behavior is conservative by 6.7%, the model for end-plate yielding is conservative by 8.8%, and the model for bolt tension rupture with prying conservatively predicts by 18.5%. The specimens that were designed to form a plastic hinge in the beam fractured in a brittle manner. The deep beam specimen fractured in the first 2% story drift cycle, and the shallow beam specimen fractured in the second 3% story drift cycle. The fracture of the prequalification specimens was determined to have been caused by stiffeners of high yield stress relative to the beam yield stress.\",","21162":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","21163":"\"description-provenance\": [","21164":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-21T08:00:52Z (GMT).

While the macroscopic performance of VSL systems is well explored in the existing literature, there is a need to further understand the microscopic behavior of vehicles driving in VSL zones. Specifically, driver compliance to advisory VSL systems is quantified based on a driving-simulation experiment and introduced into a broader microscopic behavior model. Statistical analysis indicates that VSL compliance can be predicted based upon several VSL design parameters. The developed two-state microscopic model is calibrated to driving-simulation trajectory data. A calibrated VSL microscopic model can be utilized for new VSL control and macroscopic performance studies, adding an increased dimension of realism to simulation work. As an example, the microscopic model is implemented within VISSIM (overriding the default car-following model) and utilized for a safety-mobility performance assessment of an incident-responsive VSL control algorithm implemented in a MATLAB COM interface. Examination of the multi-objective optimization frontier reveals an inverse relationship between safety and mobility under different control algorithm parameters. Engineers are thus faced with a decision between performing multi-objective optimization and selecting a dominant VSL control objective (e.g. maximizing safety versus mobility performance).\",","21292":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","21293":"\"description-provenance\": [","21294":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-21T08:01:27Z (GMT).

This work describes an automated method of screening and determining the severity, or count, of the TB infection in patients via images of fluorescent TB on a sputum smear. Using images from a previously published dataset [9], the algorithm involves a vessel filter which uses the second derivative information in an image by looking at the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. Finally, filtering for size and by using background subtraction techniques, each bacillus is effectively isolated in the image.         The primary objective was to develop an image processing algorithm in Python that can accurately detect Mycobacteria bacilli in an image for a later deployment in an automated microscope that can improve the timeliness of accurate screenings for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in a high-volume healthcare setting. Major findings include comparable average and overall object level precision, recall, and F1-score results as compared to the support vector machine (SVM) based algorithm from Chang et al. [9].

An estimated 1.8 billion people rely on unsafe drinking water.  This study focuses on the case of Tanzania, in which an estimated 29 million people, or 44% of the population, lack access to safe drinking water.  Furthermore, the Tanzanian Ministry of Water estimates that approximately 38% of all water access points in the country are nonfunctional.  As the Government of Tanzania and other actors work to improve water access, they employ innovations to facilitate water service delivery that is both high quality and sustainable over time.  These innovations must be field-tested prior to large-scale implementation to ensure they are appropriate and effective in varying contexts.  User perceptions of innovations are valuable for gauging the potential benefits and barriers to incorporating new innovations in the water sector.  This study investigates the use of solar power and mobile prepayment to improve water services in Tanzania.  There are currently no data on user perceptions of these innovations in Tanzania.  Thus, this study fills this data gap through the analysis of focus group discussions (n=6) and key informant interviews (n=14) collected during summer 2016 in three urban and three rural communities in Tanzania.  Urban sites are located in the city of Dar es Salaam, and rural sites are scattered throughout Tanzania.  Using qualitative methods, this study identifies themes related to user perceptions of water services, solar power, and mobile prepayment.  While perceptions varied between urban and rural study settings and within study sites, most people perceived major challenges with the current water system.  These perceived challenges included the poor reputation of the water service provider, health problems related to water, and the general lack of consistent high-quality water provision.  Research participants perceive that mobile prepayment is a modern solution to water service challenges, but perceive that cost, particularly for the poor, may be a barrier.  Generally, people in the rural setting perceive that solar power will reduce costs and increase water service reliability, while those in Dar es Salaam were less familiar with the technology.  While perceptions indicate that solar and mobile phone innovations have great potential in both urban and rural settings, they also indicate that there exist significant challenges to implementing the innovations.  User perceptions ultimately manifest in real behaviors related to water services, and thus must be incorporated before these innovations are scaled-up across Tanzania.\",","21420":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","21421":"\"description-provenance\": [","21422":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-22T08:00:17Z (GMT).

The LAICE Instrument Interface Board (LIIB) is designed to interface with the payload instruments and the flight computer for efficient operation of the LAICE. The uplink command packet contains commands for regulating power supply to the payload instruments and for interfacing the peripheral, called the thermal knife, with the science instruments. The LIIB is responsible for interpreting these commands in order to execute the associated functions. The architecture of the LIIB is designed such that it not only takes into account all the requirements of the systems and instruments on the LAICE, but also ensures smooth flight data analysis at the ground station end. The approach taken to build the design makes the entire process intuitive and easier to debug. This thesis describes the design and development of the LIIB firmware, to ensure proper functioning of the LAICE. The firmware design is presented first, by initially defining the architecture based on the system requirements and progressing eventually to its development at the system level. End-to-end testing with the payload instruments and thermal knife setup verifies the operation of the LAICE LIIB firmware and electronics, thus qualifying the instrument for deployment within the LAICE.\",","21512":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","21513":"\"description-provenance\": [","21514":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-23T08:00:28Z (GMT).

This thesis presents the effects of perfusate tonicity on renal swelling during hypothermic machine perfusion. Phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and PBS supplemented with 5% w/v mannitol were used as isotonic (289 mOsm/kg) and hypertonic (568 mOsm/kg) perfusates, respectively.  Porcine kidney pairs were procured then flushed and machine perfused; the right and left kidneys were assigned opposite perfusates.  An experimental methodology was developed to image porcine kidneys undergoing hypothermic machine perfusion (5 deg C) for 15 minutes followed by 120 minutes without perfusion to quantify surface displacement (renal swelling) with digital image correlation (DIC).  Surface displacement and size (thickness) were compared between the right and left kidneys of each pair.  In addition, discharged renal fluids (i.e., filtrate and venous outflow) and biopsies were collected.  On average, kidneys perfused with the mannitol solution were smaller in size than the kidneys perfused with PBS (p < 0.05) at the start and end of each experiment; however, there was no significant difference between the renal sizes at the end of the 15 minute perfusion interval (p > 0.05).  Thus, hypertonic and isotonic perfusates yielded different renal swelling outcomes (i.e., physical size and surface displacement), which suggests that perfusate tonicity influences renal swelling.  These experiments are the first time ex vivo renal surface displacement measurements have been collected during machine perfusion.\",","21558":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","21559":"\"description-provenance\": [","21560":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-23T08:00:43Z (GMT).

While carbon neutral and cost-effective, wind energy infrastructure is immobile and has the potential to profoundly change land use and the visible landscape. As wind technology takes its place as a key contributor to the US energy grid, it becomes clear that these types of projects will come into greater contact with areas occupied by humans, and eventually with wilderness and other more natural areas. This increased visibility and close proximity necessitates the development of future wind farm sites that afford opportunities for auxiliary uses while maintaining their intrinsic value as energy producers. In short, it is important for wind farms to be versatile because land is a finite resource and because over time, increasing numbers of these sites will occupy our landscapes.   In the Eastern US, the majority of onshore wind resources suitable for energy development are found along ridge lines in the Appalachian mountains. These mountains are ancient focal points in the landscape, and subsequently host myriad sites of historic, recreational, and scenic significance. In the future, these windswept ridges will likely become targets for wind energy development. This thesis demonstrates a methodology for the thoughtful siting and design of future wind projects in the Appalachian mountains. Opportunities for offsite views, diversified trail experiences, and planned timber harvests are realized by locating a seven-turbine wind park adjacent to the Appalachian Trail in Cherokee National Forest in Carter county, Tennessee. The proposed wind park demonstrates the sound possibility of thoughtfully integrating wind infrastructure along Appalachian ridges in conjunction with forestry and recreation opportunities, such as hiking and camping. The design is a wind park rather than a wind farm because in addition to its inherent function as a production landscape, it is also a place that is open to the general public for recreational use.\",","21648":"\"description-degree\": \"MLA\",","21649":"\"description-provenance\": [","21650":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-23T08:01:06Z (GMT).

Ever since the American-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq after the 9/11 terror attacks, democratic peace theorists have been pushed further to the sidelines as their theory has been put to the test and struggled to stand up to the challenges of political realities in contemporary world politics. The idea that the diffusion of democracy would help build a Kantian world peace would seem to have taken a severe blow with the rise of populist candidates and policies in the West in recent years. The democratic peace theory (DPT) is in crucial respects about the mechanisms to indirectly control other countries' economies and politics through forcibly installing democratic regimes. Though done in the name of safety and security for western nations, this foreign policy looks an awful lot like an attempt at biopolitical engineering. Has DPT morphed into a form of biopolitics? The goal of this thesis is to delve into this question and to learn what the implications are if this is the case, and what it means for the West, democracies, terrorism, and societies. For if democracies are less and less able to justify their role in driving the proper conditions for peace, we must scrutinize the role they play in international affairs in a much broader political perspective.\",","21738":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","21739":"\"description-provenance\": [","21740":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-24T08:00:38Z (GMT).

Despite this trend, the power of the state to surveille, criminalize, and detain has become more extensive, even as the state appears to be growing less powerful.  By allowing information technology corporations such as Google to collect location data from users with or without their knowledge, the state can tap into a vast surveillance network at any time, retroactively surveilling and criminalizing at its discretion. Furthermore, neoliberal political theory has eroded the classical liberal conception of freedom so that these surveillance tactics to not appear to restrict individuals' freedom or privacy so long as they give their consent to be surveilled by a private corporation.  Neoliberalism also encourages the proliferation of information technologies by making individuals responsible for their economic success and wellbeing in an increasingly competitive world, thus pushing more individuals to use information technologies to enter into the gig economy. The individuating logic of neoliberalism, combined with the rapid economic potentialities of information technology, turn individuals into mere sources of human capital.  Even though the American state's commitment to neoliberalism precludes it from covertly managing the labor economy, it can still manage a population through criminalization and incarceration.  Access to users' data by way of information technology makes the process of criminalization more manageable and allows the state to more easily incarcerate indiscriminately.\",","21780":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","21781":"\"description-provenance\": [","21782":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-24T08:00:45Z (GMT).

We leverage the caching infrastructure in Web servers for archiving. Redis is used as the page cache and its persistence mechanism is exploited for archiving. We experimentally evaluate the performance of our archival technique using the Greek version of Wikipedia deployed on Amazon cloud infrastructure. We show that there is a slight increase in latencies of the rendered pages due to archiving. Though the server performance is comparable at larger page cache sizes, the maximum throughput the server can handle decreases significantly at lower cache sizes due to more disk write operations as a result of archiving. Since pages are dynamically rendered and the technology stack of Wikipedia is extensively used in a number of Web applications, our results should have broad impact.\",","21824":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","21825":"\"description-provenance\": [","21826":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-24T08:00:59Z (GMT).

Henceforth, the current IP Lookup algorithms implemented in hardware are even though able to achieve multi-gigabit speeds, yet suffer with great memory overhead. To overcome this limitation, we propose a packet classification methodology that comprises of MicroCuckoo-hash technique, to route packets. This approach alleviates the memory requirements significantly, by completely eliminating the need for TCAM cells. Cuckoo hash is used to achieve very high speed, hardware accelerated table lookups and also are economical compared to TCAMs. The proposed IP Lookup algorithm is implemented as a simulation-based hardware/software model.

Throughout history, architecture is and has always been predominantly visual in nature. The visual dominance of architecture has often been critiqued by philosophers and architects. The thesis presents an argument that all senses \\" haptic, auditory, olfactory and vision, collectively contribute to experience a space. The thesis is a qualitative approach towards studying the significance of this existential experience of architecture in the built environment. The privilege of the sense of sight over the other senses and its bias in architecture cannot be neglected.  Therefore, the experience of the visually impaired or blind has been used as a challenge to study these non-ocular centric spaces.   Pallasmaa beautifully puts, Vision reveals what the touch already knows.  We see the depth, the smoothness, the softness, the hardness of object; C\u00e9zanne even claimed that we see their odor.  If the painter is to express the world, the arrangement of his colors must carry with this indivisible whole, or else his picture will only hint at things and will not give them in the imperious unity, the presence, the insurpassable plenitude which is for us the definition of the real.  The live encounter with Frank Lloyd Wright  Fallingwater weaves the surrounding forest, the volumes surfaces, textures and colors of the house, and even the smells of the forest and the sound of the river, into a uniquely full experience.   The thesis presents a case to defend that architecture is not merely a series of visual scenes but has a fully embodied material and spiritual presence.4 Architects and Philosophers whose studies and explorations remain relevant to my interest are Juhani, Pallasmaa, Peter Zumthor, Louis Kahn, Steven Holl, and Carlo Scarpa amongst many others.   Juhani Pallasmaa in his book, The Eyes of the Skin writes, \\"An Architectural work is not experienced as a series of isolated retinal pictures, but its fully integrated material, embodied and spiritual essence. It offers pleasurable shapes and surfaces molded for the touch of eye and other senses, but it also incorporates and integrates physical and mental structures, giving our existential experience a strengthened coherence and significance.\",","21997":"\"description-degree\": \"MARCH\",","21998":"\"description-provenance\": [","21999":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-27T08:00:52Z (GMT).

These same disturbed sites are often contaminated by pollutants and turtles can incorporate high levels of pollutants into their eggs which negatively impact hatch success. For my M.S. research, I investigated turtle nest site selection in a system dominated by agricultural and industrial land use, the impact of crop growth on the thermal and hydric dynamics of turtle nests, and I used paired field and laboratory experiments to examine the individual and interactive impacts of agricultural land use and Hg contamination on hatch success and offspring phenotype in Chelydra serpentina. Of the 150 turtle nests found during this research, 84% were located in human-disturbed soils.  Nest site characteristics were similar among nests found in Hg contaminated and reference areas. Agriculture and control nests did not differ in temperature at the time of nesting, but temperatures diverged as crops grew, with temperatures in nests in agricultural fields averaging 2.5 \u00b0C lower than control nests over the course of incubation. Similarly, despite no initial difference, nest moisture levels diverged throughout incubation and moisture averaged 107 kPa lower in agricultural than control soils throughout incubation. In my field and laboratory experiments, I found that in comparison to turtles from control incubation conditions (i.e., warmer), turtles incubated under agricultural thermal regimens (i.e., colder) took longer to hatch, hatched at smaller structural body sizes, lost more mass after hatching, had lower post-hatching structural growth rates, and were more likely to be male. Additionally, thermal conditions associated with agricultural land use interacted with high levels of mercury to impact hatching success and offspring sex ratios. My thesis research provides one of the first documentations of negative interactive effects of mercury pollution and habitat quality on early vertebrate development and highlights the importance of examining the combined influence of multiple global changes on biological systems.\",","22085":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","22086":"\"description-provenance\": [","22087":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-27T08:01:21Z (GMT).

Observation of their closest living relatives, birds and crocodylians, could never allow for prediction of gigantic dinosaurian forms. Therefore, the fossil record is crucial to understanding the evolutionary changes of these animals through time, including body size trends. The reptile group Archosauria encompasses living and extinct birds and crocodylians as well as non-avian dinosaurs and crocodile relatives called pseudosuchians. My research focuses on studying fossils of extinct archosaurs to determine how the morphology of their skeletons allowed for growth to large body sizes. I am specifically interested in how the vertebral column fits together and how the structures that articulate vertebrae change throughout the phylogeny (i.e. family tree) of Archosauria. \tAlthough major body size trends are well known for archosaurs, less research has focused on skeletal features that are associated with the evolution of large body size in that group. I hypothesize that the vertebral column will have these features. To answer the question of how vertebrae morphology is related to body size, I first described eight vertebrae from a large pseudosuchian archosaur Poposaurus langstoni. This animal possesses an accessory articulation between the vertebrae in its trunk region (i.e. between the neck and hips) called the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation. I then surveyed vertebrae from across Archosauria and found a close fit of presence of the articulation with large sizes and that it evolves independently in several archosaur groups.\",","22216":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","22217":"\"description-provenance\": [","22218":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-27T08:02:07Z (GMT).

The proposed frameworks explicitly account for the effect on demand-side energy management of various consumer-centric grid factors such as the stochastic renewable energy forecast, as well as the varying future valuation of stored energy. In addition, a novel approach is proposed to enhance the resilience of consumer-centric energy trading scenarios by analyzing how a power company can encourage its consumers to store energy, in order to supply the grid\u2019s critical loads, in case of an emergency. The developed energy management mechanisms advance novel analytical tools from game theory, to capture the coupled actions and objectives of the grid actors and from the framework of prospect theory (PT), to capture the irrational behavior of consumers when faced with decision uncertainties. The studied PT and game-based solutions, obtained through analytical and algorithmic characterization, provide grid designers with key insights on the main drivers of each actor\u2019s energy management decision. The ensuing results primarily characterize the difference in trading decisions between rational and irrational consumers, and its impact on energy management. The outcomes of this thesis will therefore allow power companies to design consumer-centric energy management programs that support the sustainable and resilient development of the smart grid by continuously matching supply and demand, and providing emergency energy reserves for critical infrastructure.\",","22259":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","22260":"\"description-provenance\": [","22261":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-27T08:02:15Z (GMT).

Already, there have been remarkable breakthroughs; small scale robots have been made that can selectively traverse the gastrointestinal tract, and others have been built that can fly in a manner inspired from bees. However, there are still significant challenges in microrobotics, and it remains difficult to engineer reliable power sources, actuators, and sensors to create robust, modular designs at the microscale. The miniaturization of the robotic system makes design and efficiency of these components particularly difficult. However, biological systems demonstrate the key features of robotics \\" sensing, actuation, processing\\" and are remarkably complex at the microscale. As such, many researchers have turned to biology for inspiration and living robotic components. In our laboratory we have engineered an Escherichia coli (E. coli) capable of producing surface display proteins to either anchor the cells, bind to functionalized nanoparticles, or capture small molecules from the environment, all complex actuation features. Additionally, we have created a processing unit that can create signals based on biological components, yet is non-living. This thesis focuses on the characterization of the surface display E. Coli system and the creation of programmable microparticle scaffolds that may be controlled by biological circuitry. In particular, by leveraging the strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin, I have created programmable microparticle scaffolds capable of attenuating the intensity of a fluorescent response in response to perturbations in the local environmental conditions. We believe this is an excellent enabling technology to facilitate the creation of complex behaviors at the microscale and can be used as a processing unit for simple decision making on microrobots. We foresee this technology impacting disciplines from medical microrobotics to environmental sensing and remediation.\",","22305":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","22306":"\"description-provenance\": [","22307":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-27T08:02:23Z (GMT).

They are cultural products with distinct forms and experiences that evoke attitudes and feelings through space, sequence and form.' 'Elizabeth Meyer    \tThe challenge that beauty is a superficial concern in landscape design has been examined by Elizabeth Meyer in her manifesto 'Sustaining beauty. The performance of appearance'. It is a hopeful manifesto that aims to persuade people about the idea that beauty is an important element in sustainable design. For Meyer, beauty is a secret mechanism which alters consciousness, that involves a social and cultural awareness. The main implication of this mechanism is a transformation that happens to people as they experience beautythey shift from an ego-centric to a bio-centric perspective, as Meyer explains'A beautiful landscape works on our psyche, affording the chance to ponder on a world outside ourselves. Through this experience, we are decentered, restored, renewed and reconnected to the biophysical world. The haptic, somatic experience of beauty can inculcate environmental values.' Combining Meyer's assertions with philosopher Arthur Danto's idea of finding beauty in unexpected places, to look anew at the urban landscape, can beauty be found in urban agriculture?    \tThe type of beauty Meyer describes is not that of appearance. It's the beauty of experience. Authors that Meyer cites are helpful to understand this definition of beauty. Wendy Steiner explains that 'Beauty is an unstable property because it is not a property at all. It is the name of a particular interaction between two beings, a 'self' and an 'Other''I find an Other beautiful'. This act of discovery has profound implications. [']' It is also a dynamic experience. In that sense, Steiner goes on to explain that there is a decentering that occurs when one experiences beautythe person is taken out of an ego-centric perspective into a more bio-centric one.     \tThis thesis presents a four part examination. Part one consists of presenting the question 'Can beauty be found in urban agriculture?', by explaining how this question was motivated by the literature review of Meyer and other authors relevant to the understanding of beauty. It introduces the site of the farmers market as a place of discovery of beauty in everyday landscapes. There will also be a presentation of research in definitions of beauty and a literature review in everyday landscapes and urban agriculture. Part two explains the methodology used for this study, including the use of film as an important means of investigation, revealing aspects of landscape including narrations, movement, time, action, and storytelling, that contribute to an experience of beauty. Part three contains case studies of films. Part four revisits the site and the concept of beauty, explaining what was learned from the studies with film.    \tThe selected site for the investigation is the farmers market in downtown Blacksburg, VA. Farmers markets, community gardens and other urban everyday spaces that involved urban agriculture had been subjects of interest throughout my research. The farmers market is an ideal setting because it gathers many elements together, such asthe various types of local produce  that the farmers are selling or sharing, local arts and crafts, food produced with local ingredients, music and performance presentations, the people, their families, pets and kids who are visiting the market, various possible interactions by being at the market. So many elements are gathered in the Farmers Market because of the relationship of the rural supporting the urban, and the urban supporting the rural. The town benefits from having access to produce from local farmers, while they benefit from the support of the community for their business. However, the landscape of the farmers market supports more than the rural-urban relationshipit is a community space, a place for many forms of exchange and encounters, one can find connections with animals and people, it has aspects of a park, and it also supports local artists and performers.     \tFilm became a central tool for this investigation to capture and document inherent aspects of the landscape of the farmer's market, interactions between people and those aspects, how the space performs and most importantly to reveal beauty. Beauty in the landscape involves action, narratives, attitude, feelings, images, sensory experiences, movement and time, all dynamic elements. At the farmer's market, all these combine in complex ways to constitute an experience of beauty.\",","22401":"\"description-degree\": \"MLA\",","22402":"\"description-provenance\": [","22403":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-27T08:02:46Z (GMT).

This study aims to evaluate the impact of these three parameters on the performance of transit signal priority. The study area is based on three signalized intersections of Prices Fork Road in Blacksburg, Virginia. A total of five transit lines are assumed to request signal priority. Green Extension and Priority Level were found to have significant influence on bus delays, whereas bus frequency is not a significant variable to affect TSP effectiveness (for reducing the transit delays). This study also aims to identify the traffic conditions in which the adaptive feature of VISSIM Ring Barrier Controller can be most useful.

In this research, the load updating method is applied to the analysis of a complex frame structure whose validation is challenging due to the complex nature of its structural behavior, load distributions, and error derived from residual strains. A FEM created for this structure is used to generate strain data for thirty-two different load cases. These same thirty-two load cases are replicated in an experimental setup consisting of the frame, supporting structure, and thirty actuators which are used to load the frame according to the specifications for each of the thirty-two load conditions. A force-strain matrix is created from the math model in NASTRAN using unit loads which are separately applied to each load point in order to extract strain results for each of the locations of the seventy-four strain gages. The strain data from the structural test and the force-strain matrix is then input into a Matlab code which is created to perform the load updating method. This algorithm delivers a set of coefficients which in turn gives the updated loads. These loads are applied to the FEM and the strain values extracted for correlation to the strains from test data. It is found that the load updating method applied to this structure produces strains which correlate well to the experimental strain data. Although the loads found using the load updating method do not perfectly match those which are applied during the test, this error is primarily attributed to residual strains within the structure. In summary, the load updating method provides a way to predict loads which, when applied to the FEM, would result in strains that correlate best to the experimental strains. Ultimately, this method could prove especially useful for predicting loads in experimental and flight test structures and could aid greatly in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification process.\",","22492":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","22493":"\"description-provenance\": [","22494":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-29T08:00:17Z (GMT).

Negative aspects of gastrointestinal (GI) function, integrity and permeability also result from hyperthermia. Saccharin-based artificial sweeteners have the potential to ameliorate the negative effects of heat stress (HS) by increasing GI GLP-2 production while capsicum oleoresin has been shown to reduce inflammatory response.  Study objectives were to examine the effects of two artificial sweeteners, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone and saccharin, in combination with capsicum oleoresin (TakTik Sweet Heat , Pancosma, SA) on growth performance of pigs. Forty-eight pigs (12 weeks of age, 47.3 \u00b1 7.6kg) were assigned to six treatmentsthermal neutral conditions (21\u00b0C) fed ad libitum with (TN+) or without supplement (TN-), heat stress (35\u00b0C) fed ad libitum with (HS+) or without supplement (HS-), and thermal neutral conditions pair-fed to HS intake with (PFTN+) or without supplement (PFTN-). Dietary supplementation began 2 days prior to the 3-day environmental treatment period. Body weight was recorded on day -1 and day 3 relative to start of environmental treatment. Body temperature (BT) and respiration rate (RR) were measured thrice daily and feed intake (FI) were recorded daily. Blood samples were collected on day -1 and day 3 to determine metabolite profiles and immune response. Following sacrifice, sections of duodenum, ileum, and colon were collected for histology. Pigs in HS conditions had increased average BT and RR (~2.7-fold) compared to TN and PFTN groups (P<0.01). Irrespective of day, HS+ animals had increased respiration rates when compared to HS- animals (P<0.04). Heat stress decreased FI compared to TN groups. Regardless of treatment, supplement increased feed efficiency by 0.12kg (P<0.04). Circulating glucose concentration tended to decrease in HS+ and PFTN+ pigs compared to non-supplemented treatments (P=0.1). Circulating insulin increased in HS compared to PFTN (P<0.04), but did not differ from TN. Lymphocyte count tended to be decrease in HS compared to PFTN and TN (P=0.052). Monocyte count increased during HS compared to PFTN (P=0.01), but HS and TN did not differ. Supplement increased basophil count (P<0.03), irrespective of treatment. Ileal villus height tended to decrease during HS and PFTN compared to TN (P<0.08). Duodenal and colon villus height nor duodenal, ileal and colon crypt cell depth did not differ between groups. Overall, TakTik Sweet Heat supplementation increases pig feed efficiency and may improve immune response.\",","22628":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","22629":"\"description-provenance\": [","22630":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-29T08:00:55Z (GMT).

Many forms of interaction, from simply seeing, to intimate conversation can increase our familiarity and  acceptance of cultural differences. In addition, a greater understanding of these differences can lead to communities with a strong sense of togetherness and a vibrancy of local place. As a means of achieving this outcome, this thesis identifies ways in which urban park spaces can promote social interaction between different cultural groups and how these methods can then be used to develop a community  gathering place that is welcoming to all. This thesis has developed a unique Social Space Organizational Model based on literature review findings relative to multi-cultural urban park and social space development. The model serves as a foundational framework for the creation of a collection of social spaces that function to accommodate the diverse ways in which different cultural groups use urban park spaces, as well as to provide opportunities for shared experiences that encourage community gathering and interaction between groups.    Additionally, the model suggests an interconnectivity of various park spaces that promote a unified social experience throughout the park. Case studies of urban parks designed for use as social gathering places were analyzed against the model. Literature review findings on character qualities associated with social spaces as valued by multiple cultural groups were also explored in the case studies to identify design elements that encourage social interaction and foster positive experiences. Ultimately, these findings led to the creation of a neighborhood social gathering place that is welcoming to many different cultural groups and encouraging of community gathering and togetherness. The design engages multiple community groups by creating a park that is accomodative to a range of needs and uses as valued by different groups. Additionally, the design incorporates a diverse range of social opportunities and experiences that maintain flexibility in their ability to provide for individual as well as community based social experiences.\",","22713":"\"description-degree\": \"MLA\",","22714":"\"description-provenance\": [","22715":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-29T08:01:10Z (GMT).

One virtue monists claim over dualists is that their view is more ideologically parsimonious than dualism because monists can do without a primitive notion of location. In this paper I provide an argument that undercuts some of the theoretical edge that monists claim over dualists. The assumption that the monist can provide a reduction of location unique to her position rests on a false assumption about the possible structures spacetime can have. If it is metaphysically possible for two distinct regions to coincide with respect to all their significant spatiotemporal properties and relations (call these 'coincident regions'), then analyses of location unique to monism will turn out to be inadequate.\",","22755":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","22756":"\"description-provenance\": [","22757":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-30T08:00:19Z (GMT).

Soft robots have intrinsic compliance, offering a number of benefits as compared to traditional rigid robots.  Compliance can provide compatibility with biological systems such as the human body and can provide some benefits for human safety and control.  Further research into soft robots can be advanced by further development of pneumatic actuators.   Pneumatic actuators are a good fit for exoskeleton robots because of their light weight, small size, and flexible materials.  This is because a wearable robot should be human friendly, therefore, it should be light weight, slim, powerful, and simple.  In this paper, a novel pneumatic artificial muscle using soft materials including integrated electronics for wearable exoskeletons is proposed. We describe the design, fabrication, and evaluation of the actuator, as well as the manufacturing process used to create it. Compared to traditional pneumatic muscle actuators such as the McKibben actuator and new soft actuators that were recently proposed, the novel actuator overcomes shortcomings of prior work. This is due to the actuator's very high contraction ratio that can be controlled by the manufacturing process. In this paper, we describe the design, fabrication, and evaluation of a novel pneumatic actuator that can accommodate integrated electronics for displacement and pressure measurements used for data analysis and control. The desired performance characteristics for the actuator were 100 ~ 400N at between 35kPa and 105kPa, and upon testing we found almost 120 ~ 300N which confirms that these actuators may be suitable in soft exoskeleton applications with power requirements comparable to rigid exoskeletons.  Furthermore, a novel soft pneumatic elbow exoskeleton based on the pneumatic actuator concept and manufacturing process is presented. Each structure is designed and manufactured with all fabric.  The distally-worn structure is only 300g, which is light weight for an arm exoskeleton, and the design is simple, leading to a low materials cost.\",","22842":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","22843":"\"description-provenance\": [","22844":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-30T08:00:36Z (GMT).

In this work, MBE grown GaSb photovoltaic devices are fabricated and tested under AM 1.5 conditions. These devices displayed short circuit current values as high as 40 mA/cm2 but were found to have poor series resistance. The parasitic resistive characteristics were factored out of the measured cell data and it was found that the photocurrent for the fabricated devices could be as much as 6 mA/cm2  higher then the measured short circuit current. An additional layer of metal was added to the reduce the deleterious resistance characteristics, and it was found to lower the series resistance down to a 4 \u03a9 average across almost all of the devices. The average JSC for all of these devices increased to over 30 mA/cm2, with highs well over 40 mA/cm2, a more consistent result than the original single metal deposition devices. Graphene was applied to the originally fabricated devices in an attempt to remove the series resistances issues as well as act as a surface passivation layer. The graphene was able to reduce series resistance by as much as 50% on some of the devices, with a corresponding 6 mA/cm2 increase in short circuit current exhibited. The photocurrent and diode current values were not changed by more than a measurement error, an indication that surface passivaiton may not have taken place. Graphene was a suitable approach for solving the series resistance issue and its use as both a transparent conductive layer and surface passivation material deserve further investigation.\",","22931":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","22932":"\"description-provenance\": [","22933":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-30T08:00:52Z (GMT).

Throughout its history, Memphis government officials and business leaders promoted Memphis as a good city to do business, free from disease and racial strife.  Despite their best efforts, they could not deny explosive incidents of racially-based violence or disease outbreaks.  Instead, they tried to mitigate negative repercussions on the local economy during times of crisis.  When the 1878 yellow fever epidemic struck, the Citizen's Relief Committee, the impromptu government formed by business leaders after outbreak, promoted Memphis as a functioning white city that was operating the best it could under terrible circumstances so the city could resume normal economic activity once the fever passed.  This became the dominant narrative, repeated by newspapers across the country in 1878 and historians today.      This narrative is problematic because it ignores black Memphians, who composed of 80% of the city's population after outbreak. Instead of recognizing black Memphians participation in relief activities, they promoted stories in the media about lazy or riotous African Americans to justify denying sufficient aid to the black community.  Catholics had better luck earning the gratitude of Memphis's leaders.  They worked with the white government and charities as nurses and fundraisers, and earned a glowing reputation in national newspapers.  The inclusion of African Americans and Catholics in this thesis tells a more complete story and challenges white Memphians' carefully cultivated narrative.\",","22973":"\"description-degree\": \"MA\",","22974":"\"description-provenance\": [","22975":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-30T08:01:00Z (GMT).

Current models typically incorporate approximate theories to determine shell behavior, which have limitations in terms of both thickness and frequency. In addition, many applications feature coatings on the shell surface that normally have thicknesses which must also be considered. To increase the fidelity of such systems, this work develops an analytical model of an elastic cylindrical shell featuring periodically spaced ring stiffeners with an acoustic coating applied to the outer surface. There is an external fluid environment. Beginning with the equations of elasticity for a solid, spatial-domain displacement field solutions are produced incorporating unknown wave propagation coefficients. These fields are used to determine stresses at the boundaries of the shell and coating, which are then coupled with stresses from the stiffeners and fluid. The stress boundary conditions contain double-index infinite summations, which are decoupled, truncated, and recombined into a global matrix equation. The solution to this global equation results in the displacement responses of the system as well as the scattered pressure field. Two distinct loadings are considereda ring loading and an incident acoustic wave. Thin-shell reference models are used for validation, and the acoustic response of the system is examined. It is shown that the reinforcing ribs and acoustic coating have a considerable effect on system behavior.\",","23011":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23012":"\"description-provenance\": [","23013":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-30T08:01:08Z (GMT).

Surface electromyography (sEMG) has been the predominant method for sensing electrical activity in biomechanical studies, and has also been applied to motion tracking in recent years. While most studies focus on the classification of human hand motions within a predefined motion set, the prediction of continuous finger joint angles and wrist angles remains a challenging endeavor. In this research, a biomechanical knowledge-driven data fusion strategy is proposed to predict finger joint angles and wrist angles. This strategy combines time series data of sEMG signals and simulated muscle features, which can be extracted from a biomechanical model available in OpenSim (Delp et al., 2007). A support vector regression (SVR) model is used to firstly predict muscle features from sEMG signals and then to predict joint angles from the estimated muscle features. A set of motion data containing 10 types of motions from 12 participants was collected from an institutional review board approved experiment. A hypothesis was tested to validate whether adding the simulated muscle features would significantly improve the prediction performance. The study indicates that the biomechanical knowledge-driven data fusion strategy will improve the prediction of new types of human hand motions. The results indicate that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms the benchmark date-driven model especially when the users were performing unknown types of motions from the model training stage. The proposed model provides a possible approach to integrate the simulation models and data fusion models in human factors and ergonomics.\",","23054":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23055":"\"description-provenance\": [","23056":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-30T08:01:15Z (GMT).

Traditionally, stormwater pipe systems were integrated with wastewater infrastructure through a combined sewer system. Many of these systems are being separated due to the impact of environmental laws and regulations; and the same factors have led to the creation of stormwater utilities. However, in the current ASCE Infrastructure Report Card, stormwater infrastructure is considered a sub-category of wastewater infrastructure. Stormwater infrastructure has always lacked attention compared to water and wastewater infrastructure. However, this notion has begun to shift, as aging stormwater pipes coupled with changes in climatic patterns and urban landscapes makes stormwater infrastructure more complex to manage. These changes and lack of needed maintenance has resulted in increased rates of deterioration and capacity. Stormwater utility managers have limited resources and funds to manage their pipe system. To effectively make decisions on allocating limited resources and funds, a utility should be able to understand and assess the performance of its pipe system. There is no standard rating system or comprehensive list of performance parameters for stormwater pipe infrastructure. Previous research has identified performance parameters affecting stormwater pipes and developed a performance index using a weighted factor method. However, the weighted performance index model does not capture interdependencies between performance parameters. This research developed a comprehensive list of parameters affecting stormwater pipe performance. This research also developed a performance index using fuzzy inference method to capture interdependencies among parameters. The performance index was evaluated and validated with the pipe ratings provided by one stormwater utility to document its effectiveness in real world conditions.\",","23098":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23099":"\"description-provenance\": [","23100":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-01T08:00:22Z (GMT).

To increase throughput, the computing  industry has turned to multiprocessing; that is, executing   computations in parallel on separate processing units. Making use of these  additional units requires  support from the operating system (OS). Indeed, most modern operating systems  do have the capability of recognizing and utilizing multiprocessor hardware.   Pintos is an instructional operating system used by many institutions to teach  important operating systems concepts. Pintos aims to increase student  engagement by providing challenging programming projects in which students  personally implement  many core functionalities of an operating system. However, prior to this work,  Pintos was a  uniprocessor OS. This makes it difficult for Pintos to expose students to the  same  synchronization challenges that most modern kernel developers face. In  addition, the first structured project, aimed at teaching scheduling policies,  requires students to implement an uniprocessor variant of MLFQS scheduler which  is no longer used in modern systems.   We implemented Symmetric MultiProcessing (SMP) support in Pintos. We also  created a new scheduling assignment to expose students to a multiprocessor  proportional-share scheduling policy called Completely Fair Scheduler and to  introduce them to the concept of load balancing. Finally, we evaluate the  effectiveness of our new Pintos framework in augmenting students' knowledge of  OS scheduling and enhancing their ability to code and debug in a  low-level environment.\",","23140":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23141":"\"description-provenance\": [","23142":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-01T08:00:31Z (GMT).

These systems are designed to carry out multiple tasks such as isolating the vehicle body from the road/tire vibrations as well as achieving desired ride and handling performance levels in both steady state and limit handling conditions. The damping coefficient of the damper plays a crucial role in determining the overall frequency response of the suspension system. Considerable research has been carried out on semi active damper systems as the damping coefficient can be varied without the system requiring significant external power giving them advantages over both passive and fully active suspension systems.    Dampers behave as non-linear systems at higher frequencies and hence it has been difficult to develop accurate models for its full range of motion. This study aims to develop a velocity sensitive damper model using artificial neural networks and essentially provide a 'black-box' model which encapsulates the non-linear behavior of the damper. A feed-forward neural network was developed by testing a semi active damper on a shock dynamometer at CenTiRe for multiple frequencies and damping ratios. This data was used for supervised training of the network using MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox. The developed NN model was evaluated for its prediction accuracy. Further, the developed damper model was analyzed for feasibility of use for simulations and controls by integrating it in a Simulink based quarter car model and applying the well-known skyhook control strategy. Finally, effects on ride and handling dynamics were evaluated in Carsim by replacing the default damper model with the proposed model. It was established that this damper modeling technique can be used to help evaluate the behavior of the damper on both component as well as vehicle level without needing to develop a complex physics based model. This can be especially beneficial in the earlier stages of vehicle development.\",","23183":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23184":"\"description-provenance\": [","23185":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-01T08:00:45Z (GMT).

In the present study the turbulence structure of two plane wakes were compared. Measurements completed by a previous study in the wake of a NACA 0012 airfoil were compared with the measurements completed by the present study in the wake of a cylinder. The mean flows of both plane wakes were found to be very similar, however the Reynolds stress profiles show that the cylinder wake is substantially more turbulent. The structures of the two-point correlation function in each wake are also similar, although the cylinder wake had greater maximum correlation values and was correlated at greater separations. The two-point correlation was used along with proper orthogonal decomposition to compute the average instantaneous velocity fields of both wake flows. These velocity fields represent the average eddy structures present in each wake flow. The eddy structure comparisons show that the structures in the cylinder wake are larger and better correlated at longer time delays.\",","23230":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23231":"\"description-provenance\": [","23232":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-01T08:00:58Z (GMT).

Since steel and concrete have high material strengths, we currently use either steel, concrete or composites of them to build skyscrapers. Unfortunately, both of these materials have a large carbon footprint. The design community has the challenge to achieve net-zero emissions buildings by the year 2030, and the efforts now should be focused on using less carbon intensive materials, such as timber.  While cultures around the world have built with wood for centuries, recent technological innovations, such as Cross Laminated Timber (CLT), is allowing for new applications of wood as the main structural material and the potential to use it for large-scale projects. However, as expected with a new building material some constrains have still to be overcome.

Diamond Grinding is a method of Concrete Pavement Rehabilitation that involves the use of grinding wheels mounted on a machine that scraps off the top surface of the pavement to smooth irregularities. Profile Analysis Software like ProVAL\u00a9 offers simulation modules that allow users to investigate various grinding strategies and prepare a corrective action plan for the pavement. The major drawback with the current Smoothness Assurance Module\u00a9 (SAM) in ProVAL\u00a9 is that it provides numerous grind locations which are both redundant and not feasible in the field. This problem can be overcome by providing a constrained grinding model in which a cost function is minimized; the resulting grinding strategy satisfies requirements at the least possible cost. Another drawback with SAM exists in the built-in grinder models that do not factor in the effect of speed and depth of cut on the grinding head. High speeds or deep cuts will result in the grinding head riding out the cut and likely worsening the roughness. A constrained grinding strategy algorithm with grinder models that factor in speed and depth of cut that results in cost effective grinding with better prediction of post grind surfaces through simulation is developed in this work. The outcome of the developed algorithm is compared to ProVAL's\u00a9 SAM results.\",","23318":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23319":"\"description-provenance\": [","23320":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-01T08:01:14Z (GMT).

I show how in each poem, Eliot develops a set of images that uniquely depicts the entrance of the timeless into time; these images offer ways of framing the problem of responding to revelations of deeper reality, which I take to be the poem's central drama. At the same time, across the whole of the four poems, this reoccurring drama\u2014the issue of the intersection of the timeless with time and the poet's response to this intersection\u2014continues to develop, becoming more complex and layered in each of the poems.

The 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake is particularly interesting because it was the deadliest and one of the most damaging earthquakes in New Zealand's history. The study presented herein provides insights into the liquefaction hazards in Napier and Hastings based on the assessment of data from the 1931 Hawke's Bay event. Previous studies on the liquefaction hazard of the region have been performed, but the present work differs from those in that the liquefaction triggering and severity procedures are used to see if they can accurately predict observations from the 1931 event. Towards this end, the Cone Penetration Test (CPT)-based liquefaction triggering evaluations are used in liquefaction vulnerability assessment frameworks. It was found that liquefaction hazard in Napier is greater than Hastings. Additionally, Liquefaction Potential Index and Liquefaction Severity Number distributions across Napier and Hastings suggest that the analysis frameworks used are over-predicting the liquefaction hazard. This observation was reached through the comparison of predictions and 1931 post-earthquake observations. Possible causes for this over-prediction include the shortcomings in the analysis frameworks to account for the influence of non-liquefied layers in the profile on the severity of surficial liquefaction manifestations, shortcomings of the simplified liquefaction evaluation procedures to fully account for the depositional and compositional characteristics of the soil on liquefaction resistance, and the use of the assumption that the soils below the ground water table are fully saturated, which has been shown not to be the case at sites in Christchurch, New Zealand. The research community is still learning about earthquakes and liquefaction and this study demonstrates how historical earthquake accounts in a region can be used to assess the risk of the region from future earthquakes.\",","23404":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23405":"\"description-provenance\": [","23406":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-01T08:01:29Z (GMT).

The type of content varies from text on a traditional webpage to text on social media portals (e.g., social network sites and microblogs). One such example of social media is the microblogging site Twitter. Twitter is known for its high level of activity during live events, natural disasters, and events of global importance. Challenges with the data in the Twitter universe include the limit of 140 characters on the text length. Because of this limitation, the vocabulary in the Twitter universe includes short abbreviations of sentences, emojis, hashtags, and other non-standard usage. Consequently, traditional text classification techniques are not very effective on tweets. Fortunately, sophisticated text processing techniques like cleaning, lemmatizing, and removal of stop words and special characters will give us clean text which can be further processed to derive richer word semantic and syntactic relationships using state of the art feature selection techniques like Word2Vec. Machine learning techniques, using word features that capture semantic and context relationships, can be of benefit regarding classification accuracy. Improving text classification results on Twitter data would pave the way to categorize tweets relative to human defined real world events. This would allow diverse stakeholder communities to interactively collect, organize, browse, visualize, analyze, summarize, and explore content and sources related to crises, disasters, human rights, inequality, population growth, resiliency, shootings, sustainability, violence, etc. Having the events classified into different categories would help us study causality and correlations among real world events. To check the efficacy of our classifier, we would compare our experimental results with an Association Rules (AR) classifier. This classifier composes its rules around the most discriminating words in the training data. The hierarchy of rules, along with an ability to tune to a support threshold, makes it an effective classifier for scenarios where short text is involved. Traditionally, developing classification systems for these purposes requires a great degree of human intervention. Constantly monitoring new events, and curating training and validation sets, is tedious and time intensive. Significant human capital is required for such annotation endeavors. Also, involved efforts are required to tune the classifier for best performance. Developing and tuning classifiers manually using human intervention would not be a viable option if we are to monitor events and trends in real-time. We want to build a framework that would require very little human intervention to build and choose the best among the available performing classification techniques in our system. Another challenge with classification systems is related to their performance with unseen data. For the classification of tweets, we are continually faced with a situation where a given event contains a certain keyword that is closely related to it. If a classifier, built for a particular event, due to overfitting to what is a biased sample with limited generality, is faced with new tweets with different keywords, accuracy may be reduced. We propose building a system that will use very little training data in the initial iteration and will be augmented with automatically labelled training data from a collection that stores all the incoming tweets. A system that is trained on incoming tweets that are labelled using sophisticated techniques based on rich word vector representation would perform better than a system that is trained on only the initial set of tweets. We also propose to use sophisticated deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can capture the combination of the words using an n-gram feature representation. Such sophisticated feature representation could account for the instances when the words occur together. We divide our case studies into two phasespreliminary and final case studies. The preliminary case studies focus on selecting the best feature representation and classification methodology out of the AR and the Word2Vec based Logistic Regression classification techniques. The final case studies focus on developing the augmented semi-supervised training methodology and the framework to develop a large collection learning optimizer to generate a highly performant classifier. For our preliminary case studies, we are able to achieve an F1 score of 0.96 that is based on Word2Vec and Logistic Regression. The AR classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.90 on the same data.

We transition through life in a nonlinear fashion, moving sometimes closer to, and sometimes farther from, rest.  Daily, we rise for living and fall to rest. Daily, we prepare for activity  and prepare for sleep. Daily we age and endure, but our burdens may lighten with the coming of Spring or a new member to the family.   In reverence to the stages of life, I have designed a house living for death - a house that provides a meaningful setting for the stages of life and our daily transitions. The house provides a dwelling for a cemetery caretaker, whose very vocation is a daily encounter with death.   The house, living for death, is composed of aspects that call the dweller to death and to life.  Death is reflected in a stone foundation and walls for the private quarters of the home, for rest and daily preparations.  These ground the dweller in ultimate rest.  Life is reflected in rooms of timber that create a place for nourishment, entertaining, and leisure during the day.  The centerpiece of the house is a stone hearth that adjoins the stages of the house - stone and timber, death and life.  Just as the stages of life are nonlinear, the stone and timber construction of the house meet and acknowledge each other and their respective roles.  For example, the sleeping quarters have a stone foundation but east-facing walls of wood remind the sleeper that activity calls and that rest in the house is not permanent.   A key feature of the home is its  moment of transition to the west, where the dweller is prepared to encounter and acknowledge final rest in the attached cemetery.  Two rotating doors create a space for the caretaker to access the cemetery through a moment of transition.  In this moment, the caretaker accesses her tools and reorients her mind.  Transitioning to the outdoors, the caretaker must ascend to the cemetery and pauses on landing when eye-height with her charges, the headstones.  Upon return from the cemetery, the moment of transition is a moment to remove dirt, clean, and again reorient to the living.\",","23533":"\"description-degree\": \"MARCH\",","23534":"\"description-provenance\": [","23535":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T08:00:27Z (GMT).

Our approach results in a significantly expanded training dataset and vocabulary size, but has slightly worse performance when tested on the validation split. Although not as fruitful as we had hoped, our work highlights additional avenues for investigation into selecting more optimal model parameters and the development of a more sophisticated paraphrase filtering algorithm.

These studies determine driving behavior, and its correlation to safety critical events, by equipping participant's vehicles with data acquisition systems and recording them for a period of time. The driver's habits and responses to certain scenarios and events are analyzed to determine trends and opportunities to improve overall driver safety.  One of these studies installed strain gauges on the front and rear brake levers of motorcycles to record the frequency and magnitude of brake presses. The recorded data was sampled at 10 hertz and had a significant amount of noise introduced from temperature and electromagnetic interference. This thesis proposes a peak detection algorithm, written in MATLAB, that can parallel process the 40,000 trips recorded in this naturalistic driving study. This algorithm uses an iterative LOWESS regression to eliminate the offset from zero when the strain gauge is not stressed, as well as a cumulative sum and statistical concepts to separate brake activations from the rest of the noisy signal.  This algorithm was verified by comparing its brake activation detection to brake activations that were manually identified through video reduction. The algorithm had difficulty in accurately identifying activations in files where the amplitude of the noise was close to the amplitude of the brake activations, but this only described 2% of the sampled data. For the rest of the files, the peak detection algorithm had an accuracy of over 90%.\",","23621":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23622":"\"description-provenance\": [","23623":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T08:00:45Z (GMT).

By looking at one city in the Global North and one in the Global South with similar risk of water stress, I am able to compare cultural aesthetics and engage two different levels of infrastructural build out (World Resources Institute, Water Risk Atlas).  The design approach draws inspiration from Lawrence Halprin's notion of \\"experiential equivalents,\\" and proposes a suite of site scale water sources and seeps (Halprin, Ghirardelli Plaza).   Unlike Halprin, whose designs primarily use, interpret, and express natural elements, cultural interactions with water as well as natural systems drive the designs in Kolda and Anacostia.    Thus, the speculative designs I am presenting weave the experiences of sourcing water, filtering water, and water seeps into the existing urban and cultural fabric. By taking a systemic and episodic approach to public landscape development, not only will these infrastructural landscapes serve the community but the aesthetic experience of the designs also becomes part of daily life. Perhaps as Elizabeth Meyer theorizes in \\"Beyond 'Sustaining Beauty'\\", these designed landscapes \\"can contribute to\u2026]a new ethos of a sustainable perception and living.\\"  Furthermore, this project presents a kit of parts for community-based development, suggesting the ability to extend the landscape infrastructure systems in Kolda and Anacostia and providing the tools for other communities.\",","23664":"\"description-degree\": \"MLA\",","23665":"\"description-provenance\": [","23666":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-08T08:00:22Z (GMT).

Stream restoration is one method by which improvements in water quality may be attempted.  One strategy is increasing hyporheic zone flow at baseflow by addition of instream structures.  The hyporheic zone can be an area of increased biogeochemical activity, with potential enhancement of reactions such as denitrification.  However, the comparative effects of various instream restoration techniques, as well as the role of watershed setting and corresponding environmental characteristics in which restoration occurs (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, stream slope), are still poorly understood.  In this study we numerically modeled groundwater and surface water interaction in a 200 m second order stream reach in southwestern Virginia using MIKE SHE.  We calibrated the model to hydrologic and tracer data available during field tests of restoration techniques.  We then simulated different types of instream restoration techniques (e.g., fully and partially channel-spanning weirs and buried structures), and varied hydrologic and biogeochemical controlling factors driven by watershed setting.  The measured effects for this sensitivity analysis were direction and magnitude of surface water-groundwater exchange and amount of denitrification.  We found that factors related to watershed setting had the greatest effect on surface water-groundwater exchange and on denitrification, including streambed hydraulic conductivity, natural or background stream topography and slope, and groundwater levels.  Type and number of instream structures also influenced surface water-groundwater exchange and denitrification, but to a lesser degree, and the effect of structures was in turn controlled by watershed setting.  Watershed setting was thus the largest control, both on exchange overall, and the effectiveness of structures.  Human effects on watersheds such as agriculture and urbanization therefore likely play a role in whether reach-scale restoration practices succeed in achieving water quality goals.  More broadly, restoration efforts at the watershed scale itself, such as reducing fertilizer use or improving stormwater management, may be necessary to achieve ambitious water quality goals.

Smooth human-machine communication requires the machine to be sensible and human-like while interacting with humans, while simultaneously being capable of extracting the maximum information it needs to accomplish the desired task. Since a lot of the tasks required to be solved by machines today involve the understanding of images, training machines to have human-like and effective image-grounded conversations with humans is one important step towards achieving this goal. Although we now have agents that can answer questions asked for images, they are prone to failure from confusing input, and cannot ask clarification questions, in turn, to extract the desired information from humans. Hence, as a first step, we direct our efforts towards making Visual Question Answering agents human-like by making them resilient to confusing inputs that otherwise do not confuse humans. Not only is it crucial for a machine to answer questions reasonably, it should also know how to ask questions sequentially to extract the desired information it needs from a human. Hence, we introduce a novel game called the Visual 20 Questions Game, where a machine tries to figure out a secret image a human has picked by having a natural language conversation with the human. Using deep learning techniques like recurrent neural networks and sequence-to-sequence learning, we demonstrate scalable and reasonable performances on both the tasks.\",","23833":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23834":"\"description-provenance\": [","23835":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-13T08:00:23Z (GMT).

Unlike traditional tuned vibration absorber, the latch device can be viewed as variable semi-active dampers such as magnetorheological (MR) and piezoelectric friction dampers. The distinct difference between other semi-active dampers and our latch device is that other semi-active dampers can provide continuous resistance according to the amount of input current, however, the binary latch device can only provide two different values of resistance - either the maximum or no resistance at all. This property brings the latch possibly having higher maximum and minimum ratio of resistance than MR dampers. As for the operating structure, the mechanism of latch element is nearly the same as the piezoelectric friction dampers which the resistance force is provided according to the normal force acting on two rough plates. Nonetheless, because of the characteristic of the binary states output of the latch element, this make it very different from the ordinary variable dampers. Since it is either being turned on or turned off, a novel control law is required for shifting energy. Also, because of the simplicity of the binary states output, it is very accessible to implement the controller on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). With this accessibility, it is promising to apply plenty of latch elements in the same time for large scale application, such as multi-agent networks. In this thesis, an energy-based analytic solution is proposed to illustrate the universal latch-off condition. And a latch-on condition under ideal situations is discussed. At the end, a control law under nonideal condition is being suggested for real-time periodically excited system. We found that energy redistribution is achievable by using the proper control law under fairly broad conditions.\",","23879":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","23880":"\"description-provenance\": [","23881":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-13T08:00:30Z (GMT).

This thesis explores how these two organizations attempt to create space for individuals with disabilities to exercise personal agency and independence, as well as encourage mutual relationship building between persons with and without disabilities. The implications of their partnership were the central focus of this inquiry.  The analysis investigates how the physical structures, locations, and accessibility of formal and informal spaces for people with and without disabilities residing in the cohousing community create opportunities for their visibility and exercise of agency. It also outlines the structure and aims of the nonprofit that collaborates with the cohousing community, as those relate to agential possibility, including the role of personal development through a faith-based identity. Overall, the thesis employs Iris Marion Young's framework for inclusive democracy to explore the effects of the combined efforts of these two entities for the perceived agency and autonomy of a sample of residents with disabilities participating in both (Young 1990, 2000).  In particular, this analysis explores the central tenets of the two nonprofits' organizational cultures as those relate to political agency, by sharing the findings of semi-structured interviews with residents, staff, and board members about their experiences as a part of each institution. The analysis also details the primary features of the physical environments each FBO has created and their implications for the perceived agency of a sample of those residents with disabilities involved with both nonprofit organizations. It offers insight into the importance of identity, equal inclusivity, and opportunities for expression in formal and informal settings for the encouragement of agential possibility. The results of this study indicate that the relationship between the nonprofit and cohousing community has allowed individuals with and without disabilities the opportunity to take ownership of their friendships and relationships, including their relationship with God. This suggests that the role of faith in this community provides individuals with disabilities a chance to express agency over their personal faith life as well as their goals and ambitions. Individuals without disabilities in this community encourage this personal agency because of their own definition of personhood as understood through Christian faith.   This inquiry was based on 12 semi-structured interviews with staff, governing board members and participants involved with each entity investigated as well as review of their websites and relevant documents concerning their visions, missions and goals.\",","23921":"\"description-degree\": \"MURPL\",","23922":"\"description-provenance\": [","23923":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-14T08:00:11Z (GMT).

Conventionally, numerical modeling is performed to predict the response of the rock mass due to excavation. However, numerical modeling relies heavily on the estimated physical characteristics of the rock mass. Unless dense, costly sampling of the rock mass has been performed, the results of the modeling are not robust. Seismic tomography offers a unique advantage of monitoring the rock mass response over conventional numerical modeling because it is able to measure the true alteration in response to excavation (Westman, 2003). This paper utilizes a tomographic inversion scheme using the Fast Marching Method for raypath tracing and the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique to solve the p-wave velocity model of an underground mine and surrounding rock mass. The inversion scheme presented is tested using a data set from Creighton Mine in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada and includes 9,270 distinct events over 62 days. A total of 53 geophones recorded 191,856 p-waves that are able to be used for inversion. Temporal monitoring of the seismic p-wave velocity in the vicinity of a known Mw 2.6 fault-slip event that occurred on March 14th is performed by creating tomograms of the axial plane at the depth of the event and of an oblique plane where a dense distribution of events occurred including the March 14th event. Tomograms are produced on a weekly basis leading up to the event and also on a daily basis three days before the event. The weekly tomograms reveal a decrease in p-wave velocity in the vicinity of the Mw 2.6 event as time approaches the event and then a significant increase 1,600 ft/sec larger than the background velocity the week of the event. The daily tomograms reveal a 1,200 ft/sec velocity increase in the same area from March 13th to March 14th, however, no trends in the daily or weekly tomograms prior to the date of the March 14th event suggest the known event is imminent.\",","24009":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24010":"\"description-provenance\": [","24011":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-15T08:01:15Z (GMT).

These asymmetries have not been fully assessed in healthy athletes. PURPOSE To quantify side-to-side symmetry in secondary injury predictors in healthy athletes and compare these metrics to those measured in previous cohorts of ACL-R patients, as well as to assess differences in these metrics between two landing tasks and between sexes. METHODS 60 healthy recreational athletes performed seven trials of a stop-jump task and seven trials of a single-leg hop for distance on each limb. The kinematics and kinetics of the first landing of the stop-jump and the landing of the single-leg hop were analyzed with a 10-camera motion analysis system (240Hz) and 2 embedded force plates (1920Hz). Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated for each variable and compared between subject groups, tasks, and sexes with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests (p<0.05). RESULTS Control subjects exhibited asymmetry in hop distance (p=0.006). ACL-R subjects displayed greater asymmetry in knee flexion variables, peak forces, and peak knee extension moments during the bilateral landing (p<0.001) and in hop distance (p<0.001). Control subjects showed greater asymmetry in knee flexion variables during the single-leg hop (p<0.001). Males and females showed similar symmetry in both tasks. CONCLUSIONS Symmetry cannot be assumed in control subjects in all metrics. Asymmetries are more prevalent in ACL-R athletes than in healthy controls. Future work will continue to examine the usefulness of each metric in assessing ACL-R rehabilitation.\",","24054":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24055":"\"description-provenance\": [","24056":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-15T08:01:22Z (GMT).

EcoRoutes typically increase travel time and in some cases this increase is constrained for a viable route. While significant research on EcoRouting exists for conventional vehicles, incorporating the novel aspects of plug-in hybrids opens new areas to be explored.   A prototype EcoRouting system has been developed on the MATLAB platform that takes in map information and converts it to a graph of nodes containing route information such as speed and grade. Various routes between the origin and destination of the vehicle are selected and the total energy consumption and travel time for each route are estimated using a vehicle model. The route with the minimum energy consumption will be selected as the EcoRoute unless there is a significant difference between the minimum time route and the EcoRoute. In this case, selecting a sub-optimal route as the EcoRoute will increase the probability that the driver uses a lower fuel consumption route. EcoRouting has the potential to increase the fuel efficiency for powertrains designed mainly for performance, and we examine the sensitivity of the increased efficiency to various vehicle and terrain features. The reduction in energy consumption can be achieved independent of powertrain modifications and can be scaled using publicly available parameters.\",","24102":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24103":"\"description-provenance\": [","24104":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-15T08:01:30Z (GMT).

Researchers across varying disciplines have an interest in leveraging DLRL's collections of tweets for their own analyses. However, due to the steep learning curve involved with the required tools (Spark, Scala, HBase, etc.), simply converting the Twitter data into a workable format can be a cumbersome task in itself. This prompted the effort to build a framework that will help in developing code to analyze the Twitter data, run on arbitrary tweet collections, and enable developers to leverage projects designed with this general use in mind. The intent of this thesis work is to create an extensible framework of tools and data structures to represent Twitter data at a higher level and eliminate the need to work with raw text, so as to make the development of new analytics tools faster, easier, and more efficient. To represent this data, several data structures were designed to operate on top of the Hadoop and Spark libraries of tools. The first set of data structures is an abstract representation of a tweet at a basic level, as well as several concrete implementations which represent varying levels of detail to correspond with common sources of tweet data. The second major data structure is a collection structure designed to represent collections of tweet data structures and provide ways to filter, clean, and process the collections. All of these data structures went through an iterative design process based on the needs of the developers. The effectiveness of this effort was demonstrated in four distinct case studies. In the first case study, the framework was used to build a new tool that selects Twitter data from DLRL's archive of tweets, cleans those tweets, and performs sentiment analysis within the topics of a collection's topic model. The second case study applies the provided tools for the purpose of sociolinguistic studies. The third case study explores large datasets to accumulate all possible analyses on the datasets. The fourth case study builds metadata by expanding the shortened URLs contained in the tweets and storing them as metadata about the collections. The framework proved to be useful and cut development time for all four of the case studies.\",","24190":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24191":"\"description-provenance\": [","24192":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-18T08:00:20Z (GMT).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of hay preservatives on the stability of containerized hay.  Treatments included 1) propionic acid at baling, 2) propiopnic acid at baling + surface applied propionic acid at container loading, 3) propionic acid at baling + ammonization of the container after loading, and 4) no preservatives.  Propionic acid was applied at a rate of 2.5 kg Mg-1 of hay at baling to all treatments except the control.  Hay was then stored for 5 weeks before compressing to a density of 320.0 kg m-3. Immediately before containerizing hay, treatment 2 received a surface application of propionic acid at a rate of 3.4 g bale-1.  After loading hay into containers, treatment 3 was ammoniated at a rate of 1.5 kg NH3 Mg-1 DM. Temperature and relative humidity in the containers were monitored for the 45-day storage period.  Hay was sampled at compression and immediately after opening the containers.  There were no treatment effects on nutritive value parameters after containerization (P > 0.05).

The holistic nature of LCCA includes life cycle assessment (LCA) as an important component alongside economic life cycle cost analysis. The drinking water industry is right now lacking a reliable cost data structure which will ensure that all the utilities capture the same set of cost data. Also, models and tools currently available in the academia and industry are purely deterministic in nature and do not cater to uncertainty in the data. This study provides a framework for a holistic life cycle cost analysis tool which will help drinking water utilities to prioritize the activities and optimize the cost spending of the utility. The methodology includes the development of a cost data structure, a life cycle cost analysis and a life cycle assessment model in the form of an excel spreadsheet. The LCCA model has the capability to compare different pipe materials, installation, condition assessment, rehabilitation and replacement technologies. Whereas, LCA model can compare different pipe materials based on greenhouse gas emissions calculations. The final step of the methodology includes piloting the model with data from utility A. The analysis has been shown in the form of three case studies - comparison of two pipe materials, two pipe installation technologies and two pipe rehabilitation technologies. The case studies provide results in the form of comparison of total life cycle costs for different alternatives and hence a better alternative can be chosen.\",","24277":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24278":"\"description-provenance\": [","24279":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-19T08:00:35Z (GMT).

Using remote sensing data, I examined irrigator responses to seasonal changes in water availability in Idaho's Snake River Plain over the past 33 years. Google Earth Engine's high performance cloud computing and big data processing capabilities were used to compare the performance of three spectral indices, three compositing algorithms and two sensors for 2002 and 2007 for distinguishing between irrigated and non-irrigated parcels. We demonstrate that, on average, the seasonal-maximum algorithm yields a 60% reduction in county scale root mean square error (RMSE) over the accepted single-date approach. We use the best performing classification method, a binary threshold of the seasonal maximum of the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), to identify irrigated and non-irrigated lands in Idaho's Snake River Basin for 1984-2016 using Landsat 5-8 data. NDMI of irrigated lands was found to generally increase over time, likely as a result of changes in agricultural practices increasing crop productivity. Furthermore, we find that irrigators with rights to small areas, and those with only surface water rights are more likely to have a major reduction (>25%) in irrigated area and conversely those with a large, groundwater rights are more likely to have major increases (>25%) in the extent of their irrigation.\",","24370":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24371":"\"description-provenance\": [","24372":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-19T08:02:40Z (GMT).

The open-source Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software (IFISS) mixed finite element method toolbox for MATLAB developed by Silvester, Elman, and Ramage is used. Meshes are produced for a backward-facing step problem, using built-in tools from IFISS as well as the mesh generation software Gmsh, and grid convergence studies are performed for both sets of meshes along a sampled data line to ensure that the simulations converge asymptotically with increasing mesh resolution. As a preliminary study of sensitivity analysis, analytic sensitivities of velocity components along the backward-facing step data line to inflow velocity parameters are determined and verified using finite difference and complex step sensitivity values. The method is then applied to pressure drag calculated by integrating the pressure over the surface of a circular cylinder in a freestream flow, and verified and validated using published simulation data and experimental data. The sensitivity analysis study is extended to shape optimization, wherein the shape of a circular cylinder is altered and the sensitivities of the pressure drag coefficient to the changes in the cylinder shape are determined and verified.\",","24414":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24415":"\"description-provenance\": [","24416":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-19T08:02:46Z (GMT).

This study measures and analyzes the performance of transactional Web archiving systems. To conduct a detailed analysis, we construct a meaningful design space defined by the system specifications that determine the performance of these systems. SiteStory, a state-of-the-art transactional Web archiving system, and local archiving, an alternative archiving technique, are used in this research. We experimentally evaluate the performance of these systems using the Greek version of Wikipedia deployed on dedicated hardware on a private network. Our benchmarking results show that the local archiving technique uses a Web server\u2019s resources more efficiently than SiteStory for one data point in our design space. Better performance than SiteStory in such scenarios makes our archiving solution favorable to use for transactional archiving. We also show that SiteStory does not impose any significant performance overhead on the Web server for the rest of the data points in our design space.\",","24455":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24456":"\"description-provenance\": [","24457":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-20T08:00:29Z (GMT).

Due to their use for standby power, these diesel gensets are designed to operate in conjunction with the grid, which relates to a fixed speed operation with a 60 Hz AC output. For operation in remote conditions, such as military and disaster relief applications, this fixed speed operation results in limiting the power output available from the engine, as well as the overall efficiency of the system.     The removal of this grid connectivity requirement could result in an increase in system efficiency. At a given load, the engine operates more efficiently at lower speeds, which corresponds to an increase in the system efficiency. This low speed operation also results in lower power output. Knowledge of the load is important in order to determine the most efficient operating point for fixed speed operations.    Operating at a higher power output for a given speed also results in higher system efficiency. The addition of a battery pack will allow for a higher apparent load, resulting in higher operating efficiency. The addition of a battery pack will also allow for energy storage, which allows for a higher operating efficiency, as well as \\"engine off time\\". A controlled series capacitor converter should be used to ensure that the maximum power is transferred from the genset to the battery/load. Knowledge of the load and equipment available should be used in order to determine the ideal dispatch strategy.    Overall, operation at the grid frequency limits the efficiency of the overall system for remote operations where grid frequency is not required. The simulated genset had an efficiency of 24% for a 3 kW when operated at 1800 RPM, and increase from the 17% efficiency at it normal operating speed of 3600 RPM. This corresponded to a fuel savings of 3 gallons over 24 hours of continuous operation. When a battery is incorporated into the system, the efficiency of the system will increase for a given output load. For example, the simulated genset has an efficiency of 15% for a 1 kW load, which increases to 24% when a battery is added and charged at 2 kW.\",","24535":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24536":"\"description-provenance\": [","24537":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-20T08:01:02Z (GMT).

Recently, inspired by the downy covering of owl feathers, researchers developed treatments that can be applied to the trailing edge to significantly reduce trailing edge noise. It was hypothesized that the noise reduction was due to manipulating the incoming turbulence, rather than the physical trailing edge itself, representing a new method of noise control. However, only acoustic measurements were reported, meaning the associated flow physics were still unknown. This thesis describes a comprehensive wall jet experiment to measure the flow effects near the bio-inspired treatments, termed \u201cfinlets\u201d and \u201crails,\u201d and relate those flow effects to the noise reduction. This was done using far-field microphones, a single hot-wire probe, and surface pressure fluctuation microphones. The far-field noise results showed that each treatment successfully reduced the noise, by up to 7 dB in some cases. The surface pressure measurements showed that the spanwise coherence was slightly reduced when the treatments were applied to the trailing edge. The velocity measurements clearly established the presence of a shear layer near the top of the treatments. As a whole, the dataset led to the shear-sheltering hypothesisthe bio-inspired treatments are effective based on reducing the spanwise pressure correlation and by sheltering the trailing edge from turbulent structures with the shear layer they create.\",","24622":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"This thesis describes a project aimed at developing a technology inspired by the silent flight of owls, with the end goal of using this technology to reduce the noise generated by wind turbines. Specifically, the phenomenon known as \\"trailing edge noise\\" is the primary source of wind turbine noise, and is the noise source of interest here. It occurs when air turbulence (which can be thought of as unsteady air fluctuations) crashes into the rear (trailing) edge of wind turbine blades, scattering and producing noise. Typically, methods of reducing this noise source involve changing the shape of the trailing edge; this may not always be practical for existing wind turbines. Recently, inspired by the downy covering of owl feathers, researchers developed treatments that can be applied directly to the trailing edge, significantly reducing trailing edge noise. This bio-inspired concept was verified with numerous acoustic measurements. Based on those measurements, researchers hypothesized that the noise reduction was achieved by manipulating the incoming turbulence before it scattered off the trailing edge, rather than by changing the existing wind turbine blade, representing a new method of trailing edge noise control. However, as only acoustic measurements (not flow measurements) were reported, the changes in turbulence could not be examined.     With the above motivation in mind, this thesis describes a comprehensive wind tunnel experiment to measure the changes in the aerodynamics and turbulence near the bio-inspired treatments, and relate those changes to the reduction in trailing edge noise. This was done using a hot-wire probe to measure the aerodynamics, as well as microphones to measure the radiated noise and surface pressure fluctuations. As a whole, the experimental results led to the shear-sheltering hypothesisthe bio-inspired treatments are effective based on the creation of a shear layer (a thin region between areas with different air speeds) which shelters the trailing edge from some turbulence, as well as by de-correlating surface pressure fluctuations along the trailing edge.\",","24623":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24624":"\"description-provenance\": [","24625":"\"AuthorAuthorAuthormillican@vt.edu\",","24626":"\"Provide open and immediate access to the ETD\",","24627":"\"I hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and submitted with my ETD a   \t\t\t\twritten permission statement from the ower(s) of each third part copyrighted matter to be included   \t\t\t\tin my thesis or dissertation, allowing distribution as specified above.  \t\t\t\t I certify that the version I submitted is the same as that approved by my advisory committee.\",","24628":"\"Submitted by Anthony Millican (millican@vt.edu) on 2017-07-19T20:10:40Z No. of bitstreams2 license_rdf1037 bytes, checksum80294ba9ff4c5b4f07812ee200fbc42f (MD5) Millican_AJ_T_2017.pdf21973505 bytes, checksum523e035a354c4601becccbeca1d14ec6 (MD5)\",","24629":"\"Approved for entry into archive by Priscilla Wright (pkwright@vt.edu) on 2017-07-19T20:20:17Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams2 license_rdf1037 bytes, checksum80294ba9ff4c5b4f07812ee200fbc42f (MD5) Millican_AJ_T_2017.pdf21973505 bytes, checksum523e035a354c4601becccbeca1d14ec6 (MD5)\",","24630":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-20T18:24:32Z (GMT).

An exploration begins by simulating the design with concrete stimuli. Then, we perform an interleaved cycle-by-cycle symbolic evaluation over the concrete execution trace extracted from the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of the design. The purpose of this task is to dynamically discover means to divert the control flow of the system, by mutating primary-input stimulated control statements in this trace. We record the control-flow response as a Test Decision Tree (TDT), a new representation for the test generation effort. Successive explorations begin at system states heuristically selected from a global TDT, onto which each new decision tree resultant from an exploration is stitched. CORT succeeds at constructing functional tests for ITC99 and IWLS-2005 benchmarks that achieve high branch coverage using the fewest number of input vectors, faster than existing methods.

This research looks to take MFC actuated control surfaces one step further by pulling inspiration from and avian flight. A dual mode control surface, created by applying two sets of two MFCs to patch of carbon fiber,  can mimic the tip feathers of a bird. This actuator was modeled both using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Real-world static testing on a feather confirmed preliminary FEA results, and wind tunnel tests simulating assumed cruise conditions confirmed the feather would not exhibit any adverse structural behaviors, such as flutter or aeroelastic divergence. From its modeled performance on a wing using CFD, the MFC feather proved to be a success. It was able to produce a wing that, when compared to a traditional rectangular wing, yielded 73% less induced drag and generated proverse yaw. However, the MFC feathers alone, in the configuration tested, did not produce enough roll authority to feasibly control an aircraft.\",","24799":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24800":"\"description-provenance\": [","24801":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-26T08:00:17Z (GMT).

Active suspension systems on the other hand are rarely found, however, they offer great opportunities to close the gap of the well-known trade-off between ride comfort and handling. Besides that, they can also be used to mitigate single event disturbances, an objective of the USA army as announced in a solicitation which initiated and motivated this research. In addition to that, several studies were found stating the impact and danger of potholes and their impact on the vehicle and passenger.  Reviewing the literature, several control strategies for controlling active suspension systems were found. However, most of these approaches used feedback control and did not try to mitigate single event disturbances. Since literature also suggested making use of look ahead preview, research at the Performance Engineering Research Lab at Virginia Tech was started in 2015 combining look ahead preview and an adaptive system to generate optimal force profiles. This introductory research succeeded and proved the used approach to be very promising. However, the used adaptive system was not designed to operate in real-time and did not show any correlation between different road profiles.  Therefore, the main objective of this research project is to evaluate and analyze each of the adaptive systems by searching for correlations in their solutions. The results then should be used in order to design a control law which emulates the adaptive system and can be used in a real-time environment.  First, an overall research methodology was derived. According to this a software application was developed which extracts ideal force profiles from single event disturbance signals in order to mitigate their impact to the vehicle. The application uses a quarter car model with a partially loaded active suspension system, a set of predefined road profiles, a road profile preprocessor, and an adaptive algorithm. The preprocessing includes geometric filtering using a Tandem-Cam Model and the adaptive processor used an iterative version of the Filtered-X Last-Mean-Square algorithm.  During evaluation and analysis of several generated data sets, high correlations in the generated and adjusted adaptive systems were discovered. From these an empirical and theoretical universal filter model was derived, which was then used to design an open-loop control law named Optimal Force Control.  The original control law and an adjusted version designed for a real-time environment were tested for all predefined road profiles over all considered vehicle velocities and prove to perform much better than the offline solution using the adaptive system.  In summary, a control law named Optimal Force Control was designed which can be used and implemented in a vehicle to extract an analytical and ideal force profile given a road profile input. Implementing an active suspension system with tracking controller, this approach can be used in order to mitigate single event disturbance signals by reducing the vertical vehicle acceleration.\",","24844":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24845":"\"description-provenance\": [","24846":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-27T08:00:14Z (GMT).

The system was discovered in France and first adopted in the U.S. by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. In 2012 the system was modified and adopted by Virginia, with research being carried out at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). The research focused on multiple items involving the system, but the most relevant one is that regarding the transverse bending behavior of the system for different geometries, and joint types between adjacent precast beam members. The study found that using a joint system without any mechanical connection between adjacent beams was most efficient, and gave adequate performance under monotonic loading. The study recommended cyclic load testing be carried out on this joint type, as well as a welded joint similar to those found in decked bulb-T systems. The research contained herein presents the setup and results of this testing. From the work it was found that the no-connection joint behaves adequately under cyclic loading at service loads, however surface roughening between precast and cast-in-place concrete must be adequate. The welded connection behaves well, granted the surfaces to be welded are properly prepared. From these results it is recommended to evaluate different surface roughening techniques, and repeat the cyclic testing using the best. The surface roughening technique chosen should be used to provide guidance on this aspect of construction with inverted T-beams.\",","24930":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24931":"\"description-provenance\": [","24932":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-02T08:00:21Z (GMT).

A near real-time hydrologic simulation framework by coupling the calibrated SWAT models with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) coupled forecast system model version 2 (CFSv2) weather data is developed to forecast various water balance components including soil moisture (SM), actual evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration ET (PET), and runoff (SURQ) for near-real time drought severity assessment, and drought forecasting for a lead of 9-months. A combination of the surface and total rooting depth soil moisture percentiles proves to be an effective increment over conventional drought assessment approaches in capturing both, transient and long-term drought impacts. The proposed real-time drought monitoring approach shows high accuracy in capturing drought onset and propagation and shows a high degree of similarity with the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), the long-term (PDSI, PHDI, SPI-9 and SPI-12), and the short-term (Palmer Z index, SPI-1 and SPI-6) drought indices.\",","24975":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","24976":"\"description-provenance\": [","24977":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-03T12:58:50Z (GMT).

This work presents a novel online delay prediction approach that predicts the message delay at runtime based on real-time traffic information on CAN. It leverages the proposed method to improve control quality, by compensating for the message delay using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm in designing the controller. By simulating an automotive Cruise Control system and a DC Motor plant in a CAN environment, it goes on to demonstrate that the delay prediction is accurate, and that the MPC design which takes the message delay into consideration, performs considerably better. It also implements the proposed method on an 8-bit 16MHz ATmega328P microcontroller and measures the execution time overhead.

While global positioning system (GPS) is usually sufficient in outdoor clear sky conditions, its functionality is limited in urban canyons and indoor locations due to the absence of clear line-of-sight between the MD to be localized and a sufficient number of navigation satellites. In such scenarios, the ubiquitous nature of cellular networks makes them a natural choice for localization of MDs. Traditionally, localization in cellular networks has been studied using system level simulations by fixing base station (BS) geometries. However, with the increasing irregularity of the BS locations (especially due to capacity-driven small cell deployments), the system insights obtained by considering simple BS geometries may not carry over to real-world deployments. This necessitates the need to study localization performance under statistical (random) spatial models, which is the main theme of this work.  In this thesis, we use powerful tools from stochastic geometry and point process theory to develop a tractable analytical model to study the localizability (ability to get a location fix) of an MD in single-tier and heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). More importantly, we study how availability of information about the location of proximate BSs at the MD impacts localizability. To this end, we derive tractable expressions, bounds, and approximations for the localizability probability of an MD. These expressions depend on several key system parameters, and can be used to infer valuable system insights. Using these expressions, we quantify the gains achieved in localizability of an MD when information about the location of proximate BSs is incorporated in the model. As expected, our results demonstrate that localizability improves with the increase in density of BS deployments.\",","25064":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25065":"\"description-provenance\": [","25066":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-04T08:00:17Z (GMT).

These safety factors provide a buffer against failure due to the random or un-modeled behavior, which may lead the system to exceed these limits. However these safety factors are not directly related to the likelihood of a failure event occurring. If the safety factors are poorly chosen, the system may fail unexpectedly or it may have a design which is too conservative. Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) is an alternative approach which directly considers the likelihood of failure by incorporating a reliability analysis step such as the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM). The FORM analysis requires the solution of an optimization problem however, so implementing this approach into an RBDO routine creates a double-loop optimization structure. For large problems such as Reliability-Based Topology Optimization (RBTO), numeric sensitivity analysis becomes computationally intractable. In this thesis, a general approach to the sensitivity analysis of nested functions is developed from the Lagrange Multiplier Theorem and then applied to several Reliability-Based Design Optimization problems, including topology optimization. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, requiring only a single solution of the FORM problem each iteration.\",","25108":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25109":"\"description-provenance\": [","25110":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-04T08:00:24Z (GMT).

The intermittent operation of gas-fired plants to balance wind generation introduces spatiotemporal fluctuations of increasing gas demand. At the heart of modeling, monitoring, and control of gas networks is a set of nonlinear equations relating nodal gas injections and pressures to flows over pipelines. Given gas demands at all points of the network, the gas flow task aims at finding the rest of the physical quantities. For a tree network, the problem enjoys a closed-form solution; yet solving the equations for practical meshed networks is non-trivial. This problem is posed here as a feasibility problem involving quadratic equalities and inequalities, and is further relaxed to a convex semidefinite program (SDP) minimization. Drawing parallels to the power flow problem, the relaxation is shown to be exact if the cost function is judiciously designed using a representative set of network states. Numerical tests on a Belgian gas network corroborate the superiority of the novel method in recovering the actual gas network state over a Newton-Raphson solver. This thesis also considers the coupled infrastructures of natural gas and electric power systems. The gas and electric networks are coupled through gas-fired generators, which serve as shoulder and peaking plants for the electric power system. The optimal dispatch of coupled natural gas and electric power systems is posed as a relaxed convex minimization problem, which is solved using the feasible point pursuit (FPP) algorithm. For a decentralized solution, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used in collaboration with the FPP. Numerical experiments conducted on a Belgian gas network connected to the IEEE 14 bus benchmark system corroborate significant enhancements on computational efficiency compared with the centralized FPP-based approach.\",","25150":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25151":"\"description-provenance\": [","25152":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-04T08:00:32Z (GMT).

This work is motivated by applications of learning autonomous navigation for aerial robots in structural inspec- tion. A naive RL implementation suffers from curse of dimensionality in large continuous state spaces. Gaussian Processes (GPs) exploit the spatial correlation to approximate state- action transition dynamics or value function in large state spaces. By incorporating GPs in naive Q-learning we achieve better performance in smaller number of samples. The evalua- tion is performed using simulations with an aerial robot. We also present a Multi-Fidelity Reinforcement Learning (MFRL) algorithm that leverages Gaussian Processes to learn the optimal policy in a real world environment leveraging samples gathered from a lower fidelity simulator. In MFRL, an agent uses multiple simulators of the real environment to perform actions. With multiple levels of fidelity in a simulator chain, the number of samples used in successively higher simulators can be reduced.\",","25193":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25194":"\"description-provenance\": [","25195":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-04T08:00:43Z (GMT).

Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and random number generators (RNGs) provide methods to generate security keys for data encryption.  Transducers used in the energy harvesting systems of wireless sensor nodes, can generate the PUFs and RNGs.  These transducers include piezoelectric devices (piezo), thermoelectric generators (TEG) and solar cells.  This research studies the electrical properties of transducers at normal and low operating levels for electrical responses that can be used in PUF generation and random number generation respectively.   The PUF generation discussed in this study analyzes the resonance frequency of 10 piezos, and the open-circuit voltages of 5 TEGs and 5 solar cells.  The transducers are tested multiple times over a 10-day period to evaluate PUF reproducibility and reliability characteristics. The random number generation is accomplished by applying a low-level vibration, thermal or light excitation to each respective transducer. The generated electrical signals are amplified and digitally processed and analyzed using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Statistical Test Suite.   The experiment results for the PUF generation are promising and indicate that the piezos are the better choice due to their stable frequency output. Each transducer was able to produce random numbers and pass the NIST tests, but the TEGs passed the NIST tests more often than the other transducers. These results offer a preliminary basis for transducers to be used directly in security applications.\",","25235":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25236":"\"description-provenance\": [","25237":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-05T08:00:16Z (GMT).

Students in Computer Systems must manage a pool of threads to facilitate the shared execution of dynamically created tasks. This project is difficult because students must overcome the challenges of concurrent programming and conform to the project's specific semantic requirements. When working on the project, many students received inconsistent test results and were left confused when debugging. The suggested debugging tool, Helgrind, is a general-purpose thread error detector. It is limited in its ability to help fix bugs because it lacks knowledge of the specific semantic requirements of the fork-join framework. Thus, there is a need for a special-purpose tool tailored for this project. We implemented Willgrind, a debugging tool that checks the behavior of fork-join frameworks implemented by students through dynamic program analysis. Using the Valgrind framework for instrumentation, checking statements are inserted into the code to detect deadlock, ordering violations, and semantic violations at run-time. Additionally, we extended Willgrind with happens-before based checking in WillgrindPlus. This tool checks for ordering violations that do not manifest themselves in a given execution but could in others.   In a user study, we provided the tools to 85 students in the Spring 2017 semester and collected over 2,000 submissions. The results indicate that the tools are effective at identifying bugs and useful for fixing bugs. This research makes multithreaded programming easier for students and demonstrates that special-purpose debugging tools can be beneficial in computer science education.\",","25278":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25279":"\"description-provenance\": [","25280":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-05T08:00:31Z (GMT).

This has led to many automotive manufacturers starting production of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV's) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV's). Another method that helps to reduce the environmental effect of transportation is EcoRouting.   The standard Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation offers route alternatives between user specified origin and destination. This technology provides multiple routes to the user and focuses on reducing the travel time to reach to the destination. EcoRouting is the method to determine a route that minimizes vehicle energy consumption, unlike traditional routing methods that minimize travel time. An EcoRouting system has been developed as a part of this thesis that takes in information such as speed limits, the number of stop lights, and the road grade to calculate the energy consumption of a vehicle along a route.   A synthesis methodology is introduced that takes into consideration the distance between the origin and destination, the acceleration rate of the vehicle, cruise speed and jerk rate as inputs to simulate driver behavior on a given route. A new approach is presented in this thesis that weighs the energy consumption for different routes and chooses the route with the least energy consumption, subject to a constraint on travel time. A cost function for quantifying the effect of travel time is introduced that assists in choosing the EcoRoute with an acceptable limit on the travel time required to reach the destination.   The analysis of the EcoRouting system with minimum number of conditional stops and maximum number of conditional stops is done in this thesis. The effect on energy consumption with the presence and absence of road-grade information along a route is also studied. A sensitivity study is performed to observe the change in energy consumption of the vehicle with a change in acceleration rates and road grade. Three routing scenarios are presented in this thesis to demonstrate the functionality of EcoRouting. The EcoRouting model presented in this thesis is also validated against an external EcoRouting research paper and the energy consumption along three routes is calculated. The EcoRoute solution is found to vary with the information given to the variable acceleration rate model.  The synthesis and the results that are obtained show that parameters such as acceleration, deceleration, and road grade affect the overall energy consumption of a vehicle and are helpful in determining the EcoRoute.\",","25320":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25321":"\"description-provenance\": [","25322":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-08T08:00:25Z (GMT).

However, historical data has shown that steel deck diaphragms, common to steel framed buildings, perform exceptionally well during earthquake events. A new alternative diaphragm design procedure in ASCE 7-16 increases diaphragm seismic demand to better represent expected demands. The resulting elastic design forces from this method are reduced by a diaphragm design force reduction factor, Rs, to account for the ductility of the diaphragm system. Currently, there exist no provisions for Rs factors for steel deck diaphragms. This research was therefore initiated to understand inelastic steel deck diaphragm behavior and calculate Rs factors. A review of the literature showed that a large number of experimental programs have been performed to obtain the in-plane load-deformation behavior of steel deck diaphragms. To unify review of these diaphragm tests and their relevant results, a database of over 750 tested specimens was created. A subset of 108 specimens with post-peak, inelastic behavior was identified for the characterization of diaphragm behavior and ductility. A new recommended method for predicting shear strength and stiffness for steel deck diaphragms with structural concrete fill is proposed along with an appropriate resistance factor. Diaphragm system level ductility and overstrength are estimated based on subassemblage test results and Rs factors are then calculated based on these parameters. The effects of certain variables such as deck thickness and fastener spacing on diaphragm ductility are explored.\",","25365":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25366":"\"description-provenance\": [","25367":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-08T08:00:32Z (GMT).

As OpenDSA gains recognition, its use increases each year. This mandates a scalable, reliable, and sustainable infrastructure to accommodate the fast-growing demand for OpenDSA access.  We implemented OpenDSA-LTI, an interoperable infrastructure which transforms OpenDSA from a standalone, self-contained eTextbook to an integrated learning tool communicating with a Learning Management System (LMS) through the Learning Tool Interoperability (LTI) protocol. OpenDSA-LTI delivers OpenDSA content and interactive materials to students through a reliable and secure LMS interface. LTI integration encourages OpenDSA adoption by providing easy, intuitive tools that help instructors to build and generate OpenDSA eTextbooks in their LMS courses. OpenDSA-LTI allows OpenDSA content developers to take advantage of various tools already provided by the LMS instead of reproducing these through their own proprietary services.  The OpenDSA-LTI extendable design allows for adding new LTI-compliant exercises to OpenDSA books. This changes OpenDSA developers' efforts to searching for learning tools instead of reimplementing them. As an example, instead of maintaining the original OpenDSA programming evaluation engine, we could easily replace it with the Code Workout online drill-and-practice system.  Since its launch in August 2016 until June 2017, OpenDSA-LTI has hosted 36 active courses offered by 25 different universities in 6 countries, 41 instructors have used OpenDSA-LTI to host their courses on the Canvas LMS, and the system has 2,729 registered students.\",","25452":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25453":"\"description-provenance\": [","25454":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-10T08:00:29Z (GMT).

Many of them have security requirements such as smart cards, mobile phones, and internet connected appliances.  It can be a challenge to fulfill security requirements due to the constrained nature of embedded devices.  This security challenge is worsened by the possibility of implementation attacks.  Despite well formulated cryptosystems being used, the underlying hardware can often undermine any security proven on paper. If a secret key is at play, an adversary has a chance of revealing it by simply looking at the power variation.  Additionally, an adversary can tamper with an embedded system's environment to get it to skip a security check or generate side channel information.  Any adversary with physical access to an embedded system can conduct such implementation attacks.  It is the focus of this work to explore different countermeasures against both side channel and fault attacks.  A new countermeasure call Intra-instruction Redundancy, based on bit-slicing, or N-bit SIMD processing, is proposed.  Another challenge with implementing countermeasures against implementation attacks, is that they need to be able to be combined.  Most proposed side channel countermeasures do not prevent fault injection and vice versa.  Combining them is non-trivial as demonstrated with a combined implementation attack.\",","25494":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25495":"\"description-provenance\": [","25496":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-10T08:00:56Z (GMT).

In this study, a historical analysis of synoptic air mass persistence across the continental United States is presented to portray spatial and temporal variability and trends in air mass residence times. Historical daily air mass calendars for 140 locations across the United States for the 60-year period 1955 through 2015 were extracted from the Spatial Synoptic Classification database. The data were stratified by season, and a historical climatology of seasonal air mass occurrence was created for each location. The historical daily air mass data were then translated into a record of residence time, or the length of consecutive days that a synoptic air mass type was in place at a location. Each historical record of seasonal air mass residence times, or persistence, was then analyzed for spatial variability across the United States and for temporal variability and trends. Results reveal a statistically significant increase in air mass persistence for many areas of the country during three seasons, but most commonly across the southern United States during the summer season (June-August). However, this pattern was reversed for the winter season (December-February), the analyses revealed a general pattern of decreasing cool-season air mass persistence across the continental United States.  The seasonally-dependent change in air mass persistence across the United States may be indicative of changed or changing mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics in the form of a previously suggested northward migration of the polar jet stream.\",","25625":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25626":"\"description-provenance\": [","25627":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-16T08:00:36Z (GMT).

However, stock assessment scientists largely ignore this heterogeneity in their models. This thesis addresses the effects of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on stock assessment models using Atlantic Weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) as a case study. First, spatial and temporal variation was incorporated into length-, weight-, and maturity-at-age estimates using mixed-effects models (Chapter Two). The resulting heterogeneous weight and maturity parameters then were applied to per-recruit analyses to examine the sensitivity of biological reference points to spatial and temporal variation in life history attributes (Chapter Three). Mixed-effects life history models incorporating spatial and temporal variation revealed distinct regional and annual trends that were not visible from standard homogeneous models. In several instances, the homogeneous modelling approach produced life history estimates that varied significantly from the spatial and temporal means produced by the heterogeneous models. In some cases, this difference was so great that the homogeneous means were much higher or lower than the heterogeneous means for all regions or years. Minimized AIC statistics revealed that spatially and temporally integrated mixed-effects models were more robust and descriptive of Atlantic Weakfish life history than the standard homogeneous models. Per-recruit and biological reference points derived from these life history estimates in Chapter Three were found to be highly sensitive to spatial and temporal variations in weight parameters. In several cases, reference points used as management targets were so significantly different that ignoring spatial and temporal heterogeneity in Atlantic Weakfish life history would likely cause overfishing and decline of Weakfish in certain regions and years.\",","25666":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25667":"\"description-provenance\": [","25668":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-16T08:00:53Z (GMT).

Since the atmosphere of the Earth is charged by the sun, the blocking of the sunlight by the moon may cause short term changes to the atmosphere, such as density and temperature alterations. There are many ways to measure these changes, one of these being ionospheric scintillation. Ionospheric scintillation is rapid amplitude and phase fluctuations of signals passing through the ionosphere caused by electron density irregularities in the ionosphere. At mid-latitudes, scintillation is not as common of an occurrence as it is in equatorial or high-altitude regions. One of the theories that this paper looks into is the possibility of the solar eclipse producing an instability in the ionosphere that will cause the mid-latitude region to experience scintillations that would not normally be present. Instabilities that could produce scintillation are reviewed and altered further to model similar conditions to those that might occur during the solar eclipse. From this, the satellites that are being used are discuses, as is hardware and software tools were developed to record the scintillation measurements. Although this work was accomplished before the eclipse occurred, measurement tools were developed and verified along with generating a model that predicted if the solar eclipse will produce an instability large enough to cause scintillation for high frequency satellite downlinks.\",","25718":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25719":"\"description-provenance\": [","25720":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-17T08:00:16Z (GMT).

REDD is designed to collect in-situ measurements within this region of the atmosphere where in-flight data collection using spacecraft has proven particularly challenging due to both the atmospheric density and the dominating presence of highly reactive atomic oxygen (AO). NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has a unique AO Facility (AOF) capable of simulating the conditions the sensor will encounter on orbit by creating a supersonic neutral beam of AO. Collimating the beam requires an intense magnetic field that creates significant interference for sensitive electronic devices. REDD is undergoing the final stages of validation testing in the AOF.

These large turbines are loud and can cause annoyance to nearby communities. Therefore, the prediction of large wind turbine noise over long distances is critical. The wind turbine noise prediction is a very complex problem since it has to account for atmospheric conditions (wind and temperature), ground absorption, un-even terrain, turbine wake, and blade deformation. In these large turbines, the blade deflection is significant and it can potentially influence the noise emissions. However, the effects of blade flexibility on turbine noise predictions have not been addressed yet, i.e. all previous research efforts have assumed rigid blades.  To address this shortcoming, the present work merges a wind turbine aeroelastic code, FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) to a wind turbine noise code, WTNoise, to compute turbine noise accounting for blade aeroelasticity. Using the newly developed simulation tool, the effects flexible blades on wind turbine noise are investigated, as well as the effects of turbine parameters, e.g. wind conditions, rotor size, tilt, yaw, and pre-cone angles. The acoustic results are shown as long term average overall sound power level distribution over the rotor, ground noise map over a large flat terrain, and noise spectrum at selected locations downwind. To this end, two large wind turbines are modeled. The first one is the NREL 5MW turbine that has a rotor diameter of 126 m. The second wind turbine, the Sandia 13.2MW, has a rotor diameter of 206 m. The results show that the wind condition has strong effects on the noise propagation over long distances, primarily in the upwind direction. In general, the turbine parameters have no significant effects on the average noise level. However, the turbine yaw impacts significantly the turbine noise footprint by affecting the noise propagation paths. The rotor size is also a dominating factor in the turbine noise level. Finally, the blade aeroelasticity has minor effects on the turbine noise. In summary, a comprehensive tool for wind turbine noise prediction including blade aeroelasticity was developed and it was used to address its impact on modern large turbine noise emissions.\",","25805":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25806":"\"description-provenance\": [","25807":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-19T08:00:19Z (GMT).

This approach allows humanoid robots with ankle mounted force-torque sensors to extrapolate information about the friction constraints at the hands during multi-contact poses without the addition of hardware to the platform. This is achieved by utilizing disturbance detection as a method of monitoring active forces at a single external point and deriving available friction force at said contact point in accordance with Coulomb's Law of Friction. First, the rigid body dynamics and required compliant humanoid model optimization are established which allow incorporation of friction constraints. These friction constraints are then informed by monitoring of external forces, which can be used as an indicator of slip based on tangential force. In practice, the robot with operational multi-contact whole body control is navigated to the desired contact surface and normal force only contact is initiated. Using an iterative coefficient estimation based on the achieved system forces, the robot tests the boundaries of its operable force range by inducing slip. Slip detection is utilized as the basis for coefficient estimation, which allows the robot to further understand its environment and apply appropriate forces to its contact points. This approach was implemented on a simple 3 link model to verify expected performance, and then on both the simulated model of Virginia Tech's ESCHER robot and in practice on the actual ESCHER platform. The proposed approach was able to achieve estimation of slip parameters, based largely on time spent measuring, actual friction coefficient, and the available contact force. Though the performance of the proposed approach is dependent on a number of variables, it was able to provide an operational parameter for the robot's whole body controller, allowing expansion of the support region without risking multi-contact slip.\",","25893":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25894":"\"description-provenance\": [","25895":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-19T08:00:39Z (GMT).

It is complex in nature, occuring in clusters and agglomerated chains, and with variable composition depending on engine operating conditions, fuel type, equipment maintenance, etc. DPM is an occupational health hazard that has been associated with lung cancer risks and other respiratory issues. Underground miners have some of the highest exposures to DPM, due to work in confined spaces with diesel powered equipment. Large-opening mines present particular concerns because sufficient ventilation is very challenging. In such environments, reliable DPM sampling and monitoring is critical to protecting miner health. Though complex, DPM is made up primarily of elemental (EC) and organic carbon (OC), which can be summed to obtain total carbon (TC). The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) currently limits personal DPM exposures in metal/non-metal mines to 160 \u00b5g/m3 TC on an 8-hour time weighted average. To demonstrate compliance, exposures are monitored by collecting filter samples, which are sent to an outside lab and analyzed using the NIOSH 5040 Standard Method. To support real-time results, and thus more timely decision making, the Airtec handheld DPM monitor was developed. It measures EC, which is generally well correlated with TC, using a laser absorption technique as DPM accumulates on a filter sample. Though intended as a personal monitor, the Airtec has application as an engineering tool. A field study is reported here which demonstrated the usefulness of the Airtec in tracking temporal and spatial trends in DPM. An approach to sensitizing the monitor to allow \\"spot checking\\" was also demonstrated.  Since DPM in mine environments generally occurs with other airborne particulates, namely dust generated during the mining process, DPM sampling must be done with consideration for analytical interferences. A common approach to dealing with mineral dust interferences is to use size selectors in the sampling train to separate DPM from dust; these devices are generally effective because DPM and dust largely occur in different size ranges. An impactor-type device (DPMI) is currently the industry standard for DPM sampling, but it is designed as a consumable device. Particularly for continuous monitoring applications, the sharp cut cyclone (SCC) has been suggested as a favorable alternative. In another field study reported here, the effect of aging (i.e., loading as an artifact of sampling) on the DPMI and SCC was investigated. Results suggest the effective cut size of the DPMI will be reduced much more rapidly than that of the SCC with aging \u2014 though even in a relatively high dust, high DPM environment, the DPMI performs adequately. In a third field study, the possibility of attachment between DPM and respirable dust particles was investigated. Such a phenomenon may have implications for both reliable sampling and health outcomes. Data collected by transmission electron microscope (TEM) on samples collected in the study mine showed that DPM-dust attachment does indeed occur. Moreover, the study results suggest that respirable particulate sampling \u2014 as opposed to submicron sampling, which is currently used \u2014 may be favorable for ensuring that oversized DPM is not excluded from samples. This strategy may require additional sample preparation to minimize dust interferences, but methods have been previously developed and were demonstrated here.\",","25936":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25937":"\"description-provenance\": [","25938":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-22T08:00:21Z (GMT).

The various data sets were then compared with each other. The objective was to determine whether the two systems are collecting repeatable and reproducible data.   The analysis showed that the two high-speed systems investigated have good repeatability (0.105 mm for the Ames and 0.113 mm for the SCRIM) when measuring the average MPD of the sections investigated. The two systems produce measurements that are highly-correlated (Ames R2 = 0.9591 and SCRIM R2 = 0.9157) with the reference ones obtained with the CT Meter. While the Ames systems, with the data processed using the Virginia Tech filter, measures MPD values that are very close to those of the CT Meter, with a virtually zero systematic bias.  The SCRIM obtains slightly lower readings. The differences are thought to be due to the filtering of the raw pavement elevation measurements used by the SCRIM processing software to eliminate dropout and spikes in the laser measurements.\",","25979":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","25980":"\"description-provenance\": [","25981":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-22T08:00:31Z (GMT).

Indeed, there have been several real-time cloud applications making their way into robotics as of late. Inherent benefits of cloud robotics include providing virtually infinite computational power and enabling collaboration of a multitude of connected devices. However, its drawbacks include higher latency and overall higher energy consumption.  Moreover, local devices in proximity incur higher latency when communicating among themselves via the cloud. At the same time, the cloud is a single point of failure in the network. Fog Computing is an extension of the cloud computing paradigm providing data, compute, storage and application services to end-users on a so-called edge layer. Distinguishing characteristics are its support for mobility and dense geographical distribution. We propose to study the implications of applying fog computing concepts in robotics by developing a middle-ware solution for Robotic Fog Computing Cluster solution for enabling adaptive distributed computation in heterogeneous multi-robot systems interacting with the Internet of Things (IoT). The developed middle-ware has a modular plug-in architecture based on micro-services and facilitates communication of IOT devices with the multi-robot systems.  In addition, the developed middle-ware solutions support different load balancing or task allocation algorithms. In particular, we establish that we can enhance the performance of distributed system by decreasing overall system latency by using already established multi-criteria decision-making algorithms like TOPSIS and TODIM with naive Q-learning and with Neural Network based Q-learning.\",","26023":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26024":"\"description-provenance\": [","26025":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-22T08:00:45Z (GMT).

Crack growth being one of the major forms of failure in structural components has been studied for several decades to achieve greater reliability and guarantee higher safety standards.  Conventional approaches using the finite element framework provides accurate solutions, yet they require extremely complicated numerical approaches or highly fine mesh densities which is computationally expensive and yet suffers from several numerical instabilities such as element entanglement or overly soften element behavior. The eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is a relatively recent concept developed for modeling geometric discontinuities and singularities by introducing the addition of new terms to the classical shape functions in order to allow the finite element formulation to remain the same. XFEM does not require the necessity of computationally expensive numerical schemes such as active remeshing and allows for easier crack representation.   In this work, verifies the validity of this new concept for quasi-static crack growth in tension with Abaqus' XFEM is employed. In the course of the work, the effect of various parameters that are involved in the modelling of the crack are parametrically analyzed.  The load-displacement data and crack growth were used as the comparison criterion. It was found that XFEM is unable to accurately represent crack growth in the models in the elastic region without direct manipulation of the material properties. The crack growth in the plastic region is found to be affected by certain parameters allowing us to tailor the model to a small degree. This thesis attempts to provide a greater understanding into the parametric dependencies of XFEM crack growth.\",","26066":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26067":"\"description-provenance\": [","26068":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-22T08:00:53Z (GMT).

The first part of thesis work aims at developing a fundamental mathematical understanding of multiscale coatings by presenting a fractal model to describe wettability on such surfaces. These surfaces are described with a fractal asperity model based on the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function. Using this description, a model is presented to evaluate the apparent contact angle in different wetting regimes. Experimental validation of the model predictions is presented on various hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces generated on several materials under different processing conditions. \tSuperhydrophobic surfaces have myriad industrial applications, yet their practical utilization has been severely limited by their poor mechanical durability and longevity. Toward addressing this gap, the second and third parts of this thesis work present low cost, facile processes to fabricate superhydrophobic copper and zinc-based coatings via electrodeposition. Additionally, systematic studies are presented on coatings fabricated under different processing conditions to demonstrate excellent durability, mechanical and underwater stability, and corrosion resistance. The presented processes can be scaled to larger, durable coatings with controllable wettability for diverse applications. \tApart from their use as superhydrophobic surfaces, the application of multiscale coatings in photo-thermal conversion systems as solar selective coatings is explored in the final part of this thesis. The effects of scale-independent fractal parameters of the coating surfaces and heat treatment are systematically explored with respect to their optical properties of absorptance, emittance, and figure of merit (FOM).\",","26109":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26110":"\"description-provenance\": [","26111":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-22T08:01:00Z (GMT).

Nowadays, \\"digital\\" is usually implied before the word technology, and discussion of technology and trails often revolves around smartphones and GPS systems. However, a wide variety of hiking gear has benefited from precise engineering and product design.     Even with more digital products hitting the shelves, many hikers go out on the trail to get away from or limit their use of technology, however they may define that word. Before any technology for the trail can be designed, the diverse perspectives of hikers must be explored rather than taking them for granted. Polling hikers through digital means or even delivering prototypes for research through design seems disingenuous when part of the target audience has negative attitudes towards technology. For this reason, cultural probes stood out as a useful method for understanding hikers and inspiring future directions for Technology on the Trail. The heart of the matter is indeed a question of culture, so probes are a logical choice for teasing out a variety of viewpoints.      The goal of this study is not to design new technology. Rather, the goal is to find a way to make technology and nature more harmonious in the context of hiking. This could end up requiring new designs, but it could also be a matter of shifting perspective instead. No device or gear will ever be for everyone, and that's natural. Technology on the Trail can still seek to support both users of technology and the bystanders who are affected by the technology use of others.\",","26158":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26159":"\"description-provenance\": [","26160":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-22T08:01:08Z (GMT).

The purpose of an AVRP is to provide researchers with an autonomous ground vehicle testing platform they can outfit with sensors and equipment to meet their specific research needs. The platform will give researchers the capabilities to test algorithms, new sensors, navigation, new technologies, etc. that they believe would help advance autonomous vehicles.

Climate induced sea level rise threatens low lying coastal land, especially in regions of continuing subsidence such as the Chesapeake Bay. Alterations to shorelines over time have impacted the ability of coastal landscapes to capture and build up sediment, exposing them to continual erosion. The low lying neighborhood of Belle View along the Potomac River is the focus of the investigation due to its vulnerability to flooding and its cultural and ecological connections to the adjacent landscapes of Dyke Marsh and the George Washington Memorial Parkway. Through careful placement of breakwater infrastructure, sediment will build over time as the water rises, mitigating the effects of coastal flooding in this region. Alterations to the landscapes of the marsh and parkway allow for their cultural and recreational values to be strengthened over time as the landscape adjusts to the rising sea level.\",","26292":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"Climate change, or the belief that human activity is altering the earth's climate, is projected to increase the occurrence of flood events due to water levels rising over time from glaciers melting. Previously, shorelines have been hardened with levee or seawall infrastructure to creates a barrier between the water and developed land. Hardened shorelines may increase water velocity and reflect wave energy in riverine landscapes, consequentially disturbing natural shorelines. This disturbance leads to the gradual loss of sediment over time and therefore a loss of ground elevation. When landscapes lose elevation, they become more vulnerable to rising water levels and flooding. This relationships between shoreline types, sedimentation, rising water, and vulnerability inspired me to discover and design a threatened landscape that would capture sediment within the river's water column to build elevation over time and protect the adjacent development from rising water. The area encompassing the low lying neighborhood of Belle View, Dyke Marsh, and the George Washington Memorial Parkway along the Potomac River is the focus of the investigation due to its vulnerability to flooding. With a careful understanding of sediment capture infrastructure dynamics, the design introduces breakwaters on the site to allow sediment to build over time as the water rises.

Recent technology- and industry-driven developments have led to  a drastic decrease in costs of these storages, further advocating their usage. This thesis compiles the author's research on optimal integration of energy storage. Unpredictability is modelled using random variables favouring the need of stochastic optimization algorithms such as  Lyapunov optimization and stochastic approximation. Moreover, consumer interactions in a competitive environment implore the need of topics from game theory. The concept of Nash equilibrium is introduced and methods to identify such equilibrium points are laid down. Utilizing these notions, two research contributions are made. Firstly, a strategy for controlling heterogeneous energy storage units operating at different timescales is put forth. They strategy is consequently employed optimally for arbitrage in an electricity market consisting of day-ahead and real-time pricing. Secondly, energy storages owned by consumers connected to different nodes of a power distribution grid are coordinated in a competitive market. A generalized Nash equilibrium problem is formulated for their participation in arbitrage and energy balancing,  which is then solved using a novel emph{weighted} Lyapunov approach. In both cases, we design real-time algorithms with provable suboptimality guarantees in terms of the original centralized and equilibrium problems. The algorithms are tested on realistic scenarios comprising of actual data from electricity markets corroborating the analytical findings.\",","26342":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26343":"\"description-provenance\": [","26344":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-29T08:00:19Z (GMT).

The device was an upper level of the 12-DoF lower-body exoskeleton project, which was known as the Orthotic Lower-body Locomotion Exoskeleton (OLL-E). The hip exoskeleton had three motions per leg, which were roll, yaw, and pitch.  Currently, the sufferers of hemiplegia and paraplegia can be addressed by using a wheelchair or operating an exoskeleton with aids for balancing. The motivation of the exoskeleton project was to allow paraplegic patients to walk without using aids such as a walker or crutches. In mechanical design, the hip exoskeleton was developed to mimic the behavior of a healthy person closely.  The hip exoskeleton will be fully powered by a custom linear actuator for each joint. To date, there are no exoskeleton products that are designed to have all of the hip joints powered. Thus, packaging of actuators was also involved in the mechanical design of the hip exoskeleton. As a result, the output torque and speed for the roll joint and yaw joint were calculated. Each hip joint was structurally designed with properly selected bearings, encoder, and hard stops. Their range of motions met desired requirements. In addition, a backpack assembly was designed for mounting the hardware, such as cooling pumps, radiators, and batteries. In the verification part, finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to show the robustness of the structural design. For fit testing, three wearable prototypes were produced to verify design choices. As a result, the weight of the current hip exoskeleton was measured as 32.1 kg.\",","26386":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26387":"\"description-provenance\": [","26388":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-29T08:00:34Z (GMT).

Even with the robustness of most whole body controllers, instability is inevitable given the right conditions. When these unstable events occur they can result in costly damage to the robot potentially causing a cease of normal functionality. Therefore, it is important to study and develop methods to control a humanoid robot during a fall to reduce the chance of critical damage. \t\t \t\tThis thesis proposes joint angular velocity strategies to reduce the impact velocity resulting from a lateral, backward, or forward fall. These strategies were used on two and three link reduced order models to simulate a fall from standing height of a humanoid robot. The results of these simulations were then used on a full degree of freedom robot, Viginia Tech's humanoid robot ESCHER, to validate the efficacy of these strategies.  \t\t \t\tBy using angular velocity strategies for the knee and waist joint, the reduced order models resulted in a decrease in impact velocity of the center of mass by 58%, 87%, and 74% for a lateral, backward, and forward fall respectively in comparison to a rigid fall using the same initial conditions. Best case angular velocity strategies were then developed for various initial conditions for each falling direction. Finally, these parameters were implemented on the full degree of freedom robot which showed results similar to those of the reduced order models.\",","26432":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26433":"\"description-provenance\": [","26434":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-30T08:00:32Z (GMT).

Part of this is due to the use of incompatible communication hardware, and part is due to the entrenched proprietary systems. This has created a heterogeneous communication landscape, where it is difficult for devices to coordinate their efforts. To remedy this, a number of IoT Frameworks have been proposed to provide a common interface between IoT devices. There are many approaches to common frameworks, each with their strengths and weaknesses, but there is no clear winner among them. This thesis presents a virtual network testbed for implementing smart home IoT Frameworks. It consists of a simulated home network made up of multiple Virtual Machines (VM), simulated smart home devices and an implementation of the OpenHAB framework to integrate the devices. Simulated devices are designed to be network- accurate representations of actual devices, a LIFX smart lightbulb was developed and an existing Nest thermostat simulation was integrated. The demonstrated setup serves as a proof of concept for the idea of a home network testbed. Such a testbed could allow for the development of new IoT frameworks or the comparison of existing ones, and it could also serve as an education aid to illustrate how smart home IoT devices communicate with one another.\",","26476":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26477":"\"description-provenance\": [","26478":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-30T08:00:47Z (GMT).

Using an air-cooled design for an air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) process may result in significantly lower energy requirements for desalination. Experiments were conducted on AGMD module to study the effect of air gap, support mesh conductivity and hydrophobicity, condensing surface hydrophobicity. A novel modular design was used in which modules could be used in a series configuration to increase the flux value for the distillate. The output from the series configuration was found to have about three times the production from a single pass water-cooled system with the same temperature difference between the saline and clear water streams. The results also indicated that the mesh conductivity had a favorable effect on the flux value whereas the hydrophobicity of the mesh had no significant effect. The hydrophobicity of the condensing surface was favorable on two accountsfirst, it led to an increase in the flux of the distillate at temperatures below 60 \u00b0C and second, the temperature difference of the saline feed when it enters and leaves the module is lower which can lead to energy savings and higher yields when used in a series configuration.   The second part of the thesis considers use of low-cost radial waveguides to collect and concentrate solar energy for use in thermal desalination processes. The optical-waveguide-based solar energy concentrators are based on total internal reflection and minimize/eliminate moving parts, tracking structures and cost. The use of optical waveguides for thermal desalination is explored using an analytical closed-form solution for the coupled optical and thermal transport of solar irradiation through a radial planar waveguide concentrator integrated with a central receiver. The analytical model is verified against and supported by computational optical ray tracing simulations. The effects of various design and operating parameters are systematically investigated on the system performance, which is quantified in terms of net thermal power delivered, aperture area required and collection efficiency. Design constraints like thermal stress, maximum continuous operation temperature and structural constraints have been considered to identify realistic waveguide configurations which are suitable for real world applications. The study provides realistic estimates for the performance achievable with radial planar waveguide concentrator-receiver configuration. In addition to this, a cost analysis has been conducted to determine the preferred design configurations that minimize the cost per unit area of the planar waveguide concentrator coupled to the receiver. Considering applications to thermal desalination which is a low temperature application, optimal design configuration of waveguide concentrator-receiver system is identified that result in the minimum levelized cost of power (LCOP).\",","26520":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26521":"\"description-provenance\": [","26522":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-31T08:00:29Z (GMT).

To do this, it approach uses program slicing with respect to the variables of the property under test to generate small-sized SMT formulas that describe the change of variable values between consecutive cycles. Variable substitution is then used on these variables to generate the formula for the subsequent cycles without traversing the abstract syntax tree of the entire design. To reduce the approximation on the induction step, an addition of signal domain constraints is proposed. Moreover, we present the technique for splitting up the property in question to get a better model of the system. The later half of the thesis is concerned with presenting a technique for doing sequential vector compaction on test set generated during simulation based ATPG. Starting with a compaction framework for storing metadata and about the test vectors during generation, this work presented to methods for findind the solution of this compaction problem. The first of these two methods generate the optimum solution by converting  the problem appropriate for an optimization solver. The latter method  utilizes a heuristics based approach for solving the same problem which generates a comparable but sub-optimal solution while having magnitudes better time and computational efficiency.\",","26605":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26606":"\"description-provenance\": [","26607":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-06T08:00:24Z (GMT).

Active suspensions are far more effective over a variety of different road conditions compared to passive suspension systems. This is because of their ability to store and dissipate energy at different rates. Additionally, they can even provide energy of their own into the rest of the system. This makes active suspension systems an important topic of research in suspension systems. The biggest benefit of having an active suspension system is to be able to provide energy into the system that can minimize the response of the sprung mass. This is done using actuators. Actuator design in vehicle suspension system is an important research topic and a lot of work has been done in the field but little work has been done to estimate the peak control force and bandwidth required to minimize the response of the sprung mass. These two are very important requirements for actuator design in active suspensions. The aim of this study is estimate the peak control force and bandwidth to minimize the acceleration of the sprung mass of a vehicle while it is moving on a compliant surface. This makes the road surface a bi-lateral boundary and hence, the total system is a combination of the vehicle and the compliant road. Generalized vehicle and compliant road models are created so that parameters can be easily changed for different types of vehicles and different road conditions. The peak control force is estimated using adaptive filtering. A least mean squares (LMS) algorithm is used in the process. A case study with fixed parameters is used to show the results of the estimation process. The results show the effectiveness of an adaptive LMS algorithm for such an application. The peak control force and the bandwidth that are obtained from this process can then be used in actuator design.\",","26649":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26650":"\"description-provenance\": [","26651":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-06T08:00:31Z (GMT).

Cascading outage due to voltage collapse is a probable consequence during insecure voltage situations. In this regard, fast responding and reliable voltage security assessment (VSA) is effective and indispensable for system to survive in conceivable contingencies. This paper aims at establishing an online systematic framework for voltage security assessment with high-speed data streams from synchrophasors and phasor data concentrators (PDCs). Periodically updated decision trees (DTs) have been applied in different subjects of security assessments in power systems. However, with a training data set of operating conditions that grows rapidly, re-training and restructuring a decision tree becomes a time-consuming process. Hoeffding-tree-based method constructs a learner that is capable of memory management to process streaming data without retaining the complete data set for training purposes in real-time and  guarantees the accuracy of learner. The proposed approach of voltage security assessment based on Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) system is tested and evaluated by the IEEE 118-bus standard system.\",","26693":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26694":"\"description-provenance\": [","26695":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-06T08:00:59Z (GMT).

It is found that experience in vegetable cultivation and number of livestock owned have a positive impact on the adoption of IPM practices. However, distance to the nearest town has a negative impact on adoption. Moreover, the number of times pesticides are applied to vegetables also declines as distance of the household from the nearest town increases. Farmers whose crops face less stress from insects and disease tend to apply pesticides fewer times as well. Results from this study indicate that being close to town is important for agricultural activities in general.

HWSC exploits coincidental maturity between crops and weeds, so an experiment was designed to collect weed seeds as they shatter throughout the growing season and through a simulated harvest delay. This experiment monitored four economically important broadleaf species and two grass species in a soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) field. Results indicated that broadleaf species shattered seed at rates accelerating through the growing season, while grass species shattered more seed early in the growing season. Field experiments in organic and conventional winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields infested with Italian ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. ssp. multiflorum (Lam.) Husnot) compared two HWSC techniques to grower-standard weed management programs in each system, including both no-till and full-till standard treatments in the conventional system. Italian ryegrass populations were monitored, and wheat yield was measured both before and after HWSC application. In both organic and conventional cropping systems, HWSC treatments did not provide better Italian ryegrass control than the grower-standard treatments. The conventional program including tillage boosted Italian ryegrass populations. These results suggest that HWSC treatments did not enhance Italian ryegrass control compared to grower-standard practices in either the organic or conventional systems. Additionally, broadleaf weeds may retain enough seeds to be viable targets for HWSC. Incorporating best practices, such as a timely crop harvest, is key for understanding and optimizing HWSC.\",","26867":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","26868":"\"description-provenance\": [","26869":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-08T08:00:28Z (GMT).

In a test where bugs were placed in increasingly tight boxes, most bugs settled in gaps 4.5 - 5.5 mm high. None settled in a space less than 3.5 mm high. In boxes with constant tightness, bugs tended to move to the back, and primarily settled along walls and in corners. In both box types, bugs tended to turn and face the cavity entrance during settling. In tests of responses of disturbed overwintering bugs to common household light bulbs over the course of a year, bugs were taken from shelters and exposed to lit bulbs. Bug responses were seasonal, with attraction to light bulbs in spring and summer, but little or no consistent response in fall or winter. The lack of response occurred more often at night than in afternoons. Because not all bugs survive the winter, corpses can accumulate. Single shelter-seeking H. halys were found not to respond to the presence of dead aggregations from the previous years unless touch was possible, in which case aggregations were joined. Dead aggregations from the same year had a repellent effect. Presence of a single dead bug from the same year did not provide any survivorship advantage to overwintering bugs.

Tightness experiments indicated that bugs in crevices with hard walls prefer to settle in spaces between 4.5 and 5.5 mm high. Bugs also tended to stay on the floor, go back as far as they could, and face the entrance of the crevice. These findings will help improve overwintering box designs for collection and research, and will help pest control professionals focus their efforts. When bugs were disturbed and exposed to common household light bulbs, they tended to move toward the bulbs in late summer and in spring, but responded less in fall and winter, and responded more often in the afternoon than at night. Bugs were also exposed to other dead bugs in several ways. When lone bugs were exposed to groups of dead bugs from previous years, they went to them only if they could touch them. Single dead bugs had less of an impact. Exposure to groups of dead bugs from the same year drove live bugs away.

It becomes increasingly harder to treat and cure the disease as it makes progress. Detecting cancer at an early stage can help in preventing it from affecting an organism. However, it is very hard to detect at an early stage. The best possible way to tackle this disease is to first study it at a cellular level. This study aims at identifying various phenotypic traits of these cells in the Dielectrophoresis (DEP) based microfluidic device experimental setup and subsequently classifying the cells from the rest. A general framework for automatic labeling, identifying and classifying the malignant from the dead cells is developed in this work. The framework shows a top-down approach starting from static background subtraction, tracking, automatic labeling, feature extraction and finally classification. The data used in this work are videos of live and dead human prostate cancer (PC-3) cells flowing through the microfluidic device. Previous studies have shown that there are significant differences in morphological attributes between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. We focus mainly on shape, texture and geometry as the prominent attribute in our work and subsequently use them for classification. In this work we obtain good tracking results through optical flow as compared to previous work. For classification, linear classifiers such as logistic regression and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) showed decent results. The machine learning algorithms use Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features plus the elliptical features as a combined feature vector. The elliptic features branch out this study to another direction that is useful in calculation of physical properties such as the cell elasticity through video processing and we propose a model for the same for the given setup. Currently, the elasticity of a single cell is calculated using expensive and time consuming procedures such as the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Using our framework, we can potentially obtain elasticity for a batch of cells in much less time. Also, our cell classification algorithm procedure is suitable for real time applications and can be a proposed futuristic concept for selective killing of cells.\",","27043":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","27044":"\"description-provenance\": [","27045":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-12T08:00:21Z (GMT).

This project sought to develop a sensor system that is capable of objectively assessing symptoms of withdrawal, including tremors and high pitched cry. The system developed is composed of five wireless accelerometers, for attachment to a subject's limbs and chest, and an external microphone. The sensor system is targeted toward quantifying limb movements of the subject and recording audio information that includes samples of the subject's cry.  \tThe sensor system was used as part of a research study, and data was collected from recruited participants.

Gathered data was analyzed using MATLAB, with motion data being searched for tremor activity in NAS participants, and cry samples searched for unique characteristics. Results generated indicate that detection of tremors was successful, and that the average fundamental frequency of cry differs between the NAS and non-NAS participants.

The purpose of this research is to estimate the potential ODM demand and understand the challenges of introducing ODM using the Northern California region (including major cities like San Francisco, Sacramento, and San Jose) as an area of study and a second, less rigorous analysis for the Washington-Baltimore region. A conditional logit model was developed to estimate mode choice behavior and to estimate ODM demand; presenting automobile and public transportation as the two competing modes to ODM.  There are significant challenges associated with the service including ability to operate in bad weather, vehicle operating cost, siting and cost of landing sites, and overall public acceptance of small, remotely operated aircraft.  Nine scenarios were run varying the input for a base fare, landing fare, cost per-passenger-mile, auto operational costs, and ingress (waiting) times. The results yielded sensitivity of demand to all these parameters and especially showed a great difference in demand when auto costs were decreased from the standard American Automobile Association (AAA) cost per mile to a likely, future auto operating cost. The challenge that aerospace engineers face is designing an aircraft capable of achieving lower operational costs. The results showed that in order for the ODM to be a competitive mode, the cost per passenger-mile should be kept at $1.\",","27130":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","27131":"\"description-provenance\": [","27132":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-13T08:00:23Z (GMT).

Our approach involves two steps(i) establishing a stable, steady, helical motion for which the control surfaces are not fully deflected and (ii) modulating the aircraft control surfaces about their nominal positions to ``slant'' the helical flight path in a desired direction relative to the atmosphere, whether to attain a desired impact location, to counter a steady wind, or both.

However, the places that are most often designated as wilderness are frequently far away and difficult for most people to access. It is therefore important to understand how the idea of wilderness can be rescaled and rethought to allow for its benefits to be more attainable within common and accessible areas. Interstate rest areas provide an excellent subject to study how a wilderness experience can be designed within an area not typically associated with wild nature. The rest areas on Interstate 64 in Virginia provide a good opportunity to conduct this study due to the variety ecological conditions that the interstate passes through. This thesis explores the varying conditions of all the rest areas on Interstate 64 in Virginia and develops a design for one of them, New Kent County Eastbound at mile marker 213. This design process is a site specific model for designing a wilderness experience at an interstate rest area that provides opportunities to experience local ecology, improve storm  water management features, and increase wildlife habitat.\",","27256":"\"description-degree\": \"MLA\",","27257":"\"description-provenance\": [","27258":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-15T08:00:27Z (GMT).

For this thesis, Microsoft HoloLens was used in an experiment to see the effects of AR models on user performance and comprehension. There were three conditions for this study, two of the conditions used AR model displays and the third condition used a traditional paper drawing of the model.

Such materials are often used in airplanes, spacecraft, sporting equipment, and many high-end products. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have been research with the goal of improving the environmental sustainability and performance of composite materials. This newly utilized material is found in plants and some animals to provide them with their strength. Researches have already shown that CNCs can improve the performance of many materials while reducing their lifetime environmental impact. In order to increase the market for CNCs, we are looking at costreducing methods of producing them as well as finding exciting new uses for them once they are made. Right now, most CNCs are isolated from wood or cotton, which already have existing markets. This thesis presents a method of using pistachio shells, which are a waste product in many parts of the world including the United States. By finding new sources of CNCs, we hope to add to the body of knowledge and reduce the price of CNC production. This thesis also lays the groundwork for a material that changes shape when exposed to water. By integrating CNCs into only part of a polymer, when water is added, the part with the CNCs will increase in size, causing it to push on the polymer. Our hope is to create a new use for CNC composites to help to increase the market for them. We discuss potential methods and proofs of concept on how to create a 3D-printed part using CNCs and polyurethane.\",","27341":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","27342":"\"description-provenance\": [","27343":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-15T08:00:44Z (GMT).

The purpose of this thesis was to study the relationship between nature and architecture.

When in fact, when both nature and architecture work together, it creates the best and  healthiest spaces for human health, performance and well-being. In this project, I focused on creating healing spaces for homeless veterans; a group that is increasing in number in large  cities such as Washington D.C. Veterans are falling into homelessness due to Post-traumatic stress disorder, making it hard for them to adapt back into their normal life. Many of them live in poor conditions on the street, shelters and cars; spaces that are not suitable for people living with this disorder.  Instead, I am proposing a transitional housing project where they will be trained, offered job opportunities, and a space where they will in constant presence of nature from the moment they walk into the building until they get to their room. This is because biophilic design has proven to improve the perfomance, quality of life, and health of humans. The residents of this project will have an efficient building with communal spaces, spaces for active and passive recreation, and different connections to nature to improve and expedite their healing.\",","27429":"\"description-degree\": \"MARCH\",","27430":"\"description-provenance\": [","27431":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-15T08:00:58Z (GMT).

It plays an important role in engineering. There have been multiple works that show that spatial visualization skills can be improved with the right training.   Creating technical drawings requires mental manipulation and visual thinking. Strong spatial visualization abilities are required for such a mental process. To train students in this process and to improve their spatial skills, Professor Diana Bairaktarova conducted a class in spatial visualization for freshmen in engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The class consisted of 169 students from different engineering disciplines. One of the major pedagogical techniques used in the class was to give students three assignments on drawing sectional views of mechanical objects with a pre-defined cutting plane. All three assignments had the same six mechanical objects to assess their improvement through the class. Students were not given feedback after completion of each assignment. They were asked to do the first assignment at the beginning of the course, the second assignment during the middle of the semester and the final assignment towards the end of the semester. The students were given instructions on how to draw the 2D sectional views. The assignments were then graded by the teaching assistants for the class and the improvement of the students through the semester was recorded. Assignments were graded manually by two different raters using a pre-defined grading rubric. An inter-rater reliability was established between the graders.   There were drawbacks to this process. It was extremely time consuming since there were more than 500 assignments to be graded by the teaching assistants. Also, to establish inter-rater reliability, the assignments had to be graded twice. The process would have been more efficient if there was a software that could automate the grading process. Also, this would eliminate the need to establish an inter-rater reliability. This research aims at developing a software for automatic grading of the technical drawings. The software gives students' feedback on the drawings describing their mistakes. This would give a more complete learning experience as the students   would get a better understanding of the internal details of the object with the help of the feedback they are getting. In addition, the software is independent of the CAD platform used to create the drawings. The instructor can also upload a batch of images that can be processed by the software at once. The grading rubric that was used for manual grading can be implemented in the software. The software uses Image processing and Computer Vision toolboxes in MATLAB which enables the comparison between the submitted technical drawing and the source (solution) drawing. The software is currently developed for simple geometries with less complicated features as it is being employed in a course where students are new to CAD environment. Students can also use this software as an interactive learning tool as they create 3D models and sectional views of mechanical objects.  The proposed software reduces the amount of effort put in by faculty on grading the assignments. It also gives students feedback on the drawings, making it an interactive tool which improves the learning experience. This software can be a powerful pedagogical tool to improve spatial visualization skills.\",","27478":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","27479":"\"description-provenance\": [","27480":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-16T08:00:48Z (GMT).

The physics of frost incipience at a microscopic scale has, nevertheless, eluded researchers because of an unjustified ansatz regarding the primary mechanism of condensation frosting. It was widely assumed that during condensation frosting each supercooled droplet in the condensate population freezes in isolation by heterogeneous nucleation at the solid-liquid interface, quite analogous to the mechanism of icing. This assumption has very recently been invalidated with strong experimental evidence which shows that only a single droplet has to freeze by heterogeneous nucleation (typically by edge effects) in order to initiate condensation frosting in a supercooled condensate population. Once a droplet has frozen, it subsequently grows an ice bridge towards its nearest neighboring liquid droplet, freezing it in the process. Thus ensues a chain reaction of ice bridging where the newly frozen droplets grow ice bridges toward their nearest neighbor liquid droplets forming a percolating network of interconnected frozen droplets. Not always are these ice bridges successful in connecting to their adjacent liquid droplets. Sometimes the liquid droplet can completely evaporate before the ice bridges can connect, thus forming a local dry region in the vicinity of the ice bridge. In this work, we first formulate a thermodynamic framework in order to understand the localized vapor pressure gradients that emerge in mixed-mode phase-change systems and govern condensation and frost phenomena. Following this, we study droplet pair interactions between a frozen droplet and a liquid droplet to understand the physics behind the local ice bridge connections. We discuss the emergent scaling laws in ice bridging dynamics, their relative size dependencies, and growth rates. Thereafter, we show how with spatial control of interdroplet distances in a supercooled condensate and temporal control of the first freezing event, we can tune global frost propagation on a substrate and even cause a global failure of all ice bridges to create a dry zone. Subsequently, we perform a systematic study of dry zones and derive a scaling law for dry zones that collapses all of our experimental data spanning a wide parameter space. We then show that almost always the underlying mechanism behind the formation of dry zones around any hygroscopic droplet is inhibition of growth and not inhibition of nucleation. We end with a discussion and preliminary results of our proposed anti-frosting surface that uses ice itself to prevent frost.\",","27518":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","27519":"\"description-provenance\": [","27520":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-19T08:00:23Z (GMT).

ICSs are networked through Information Technology (IT) infrastructure for remote monitoring and control of physical processes. As ICSs integrate with IT infrastructure, IT vulnerabilities are carried over to the ICS environment. Previously proposed process controller security architectures maintain safe and stable plant operation even in the presence of attacks that exploit ICS vulnerabilities. Security architectures are process control system-level solutions that leverage isolated and trusted hardware (secure enclaves) for ICS security. Upon detecting an intrusion, the secure enclave switches control of the physical process to a high assurance controller, making a fail-safe plant operation.    The process control loop components have an average lifespan of several decades. During this time, electromechanical components of process control loop may undergo aging that alters their characteristics and affects control loop performance. To deal with component aging and to improve control algorithm flexibility, updates to control loop parameters are required. Plant model, process control loop system specifications, and control algorithm-based security mechanisms at the secure enclave require parameter updates. ICSs have hundreds of process control components that may need be installed in hazardous environments and distributed across hundreds of square kilometers. Updating each component physically may lead to accidents, expensive travel, and increased downtime. Some ICS have allowable downtime of only 5 minutes per year. Hence, remote updates are desirable.     A proposed dedicated and isolated hardware module at the secure enclave provides authentication of the update and ensures safe storage in a non-volatile memory. A protocol designed for update transmission through an untrusted ICS network provides resilience against network integrity attacks such as replay attacks. Encryption and authentication of the updates maintain integrity and confidentiality. During the normal plant operation, the hardware module is invisible to the other modules of the process control loop. The proposed solution is implemented on Xilinx Zynq-7000 programmable System-on-Chip to provide secure enclave updates.\",","27563":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","27564":"\"description-provenance\": [","27565":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-19T08:00:30Z (GMT).

The objectives of this thesis were to(1) perform an instrumented verification analysis, (2) evaluate the response and performance of two pavement configurations with a CCPR base layer through accelerated pavement testing (APT), and (3) construct models using mechanistic-empirical pavement design software for comparison with the APT results.  The pavement configurations featured a 5-inch CCPR mixture with either a 3-inch or 1.5-inch SM-9.5D surface mixture.  Each section was instrumented with strain gauges, pressure cells, and thermocouples.  A heavy vehicle simulator (HVS) was used to load three replicate test sections in each lane, with the temperature controlled at 39\u00b0C at a depth of 1.5 inches.  Results from the instrument verification analysis showed that the strain gauges and pressure cells used in the experiment recorded pavement responses with a high degree of repeatability.  In addition, the loading condition variables (speed, wheel load, and tire inflation pressure) affected the response following the expected trends and did not affect the repeatability of the instruments.  The average CV of all strain gauge and pressure cell signals was approximately 0.009 or 0.9%, and 0.004 or 0.4%, respectively.    In terms of the rutting comparison, the sections with the 3-inch surface layer outperformed the sections with the thinner 1.5-inch surface layer.  However, the age of the pavement at the start of testing significantly affected the rutting performance.  After adjusting for the pavement age at the time of testing, the section with the thicker surface showed approximately half of the rutting of the section with the thinner surface.    The results from preliminary ME Design analysis indicate that the software cannot model the studied APT sections using the default material properties and calibration factors available at the time of analysis.  In particular, the software does not seem to be prepared to model the CCPR materials.\",","27608":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","27609":"\"description-provenance\": [","27610":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-19T08:00:37Z (GMT).

Storage hardware has diversified from hard disk drives and solid state drives to include persistent memory (PMEM) devices such as phase change memory (PCM) and Flash-backed DRAM. On the software side, the increasing adoption of cloud services for building and deploying consumer and enterprise applications is driving the use of cloud storage services. Cloud providers have responded by providing a plethora of choices of storage services, each of which have unique performance characteristics and pricing. We argue this variety represents an opportunity for modern storage systems, and it can be leveraged to improve operational costs of the systems.  We propose that storage tiering is an effective technique for balancing operational or de- ployment costs and performance in such modern storage systems. We demonstrate this via three key techniques. First, THMCache, which leverages tiering to conserve the lifetime of PMEM devices, hence saving hardware upgrade costs. Second, CAST, which leverages tiering between multiple types of cloud storage to deliver higher utility (i.e. performance per unit of cost) for cloud tenants. Third, we propose a dynamic pricing scheme for cloud storage services, which leverages tiering to increase the cloud provider's profit or offset their management costs.\",","27702":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","27703":"\"description-provenance\": [","27704":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-20T08:00:19Z (GMT).

However, issues of access, availability, lack of initiatives in many areas which allow these individuals to become involved in the local food movement have plagued this population, especially the youth.  In recent years, Georgetown, Delaware has become a major immigration hub, seeing large populations of Hispanics migrating to the area. Like many locations which see large numbers of individuals of a particular ethnic group not known to the area, the need for culturally relevant and responsive resources becomes imperative. Considering that youth are a vital part of society and are widely impacted by issues of food insecurity and unhealthy food choices, it is important to address their intentions to become actively engaged in their local food system and the role that their identity as Hispanic youth plays in that intention.  To assess Hispanic youth's intentions to engage in their local food system and food heritage, the researcher selected a group of 11 Hispanic youth from Georgetown, Delaware, to participate in a Photovoice project, which called on them to take pictures of items salient to their identity, how they understood their local food system and perceived barriers. Following the two-week photo taking period, youth then participated in two focus group sessions, one to obtain information relevant to the research topic and the other, serving as a member check and to elicit further information. Findings of this study include the idea that cultural identity serves as a major influential factor to youth engagement in the food movement and in food heritage. Cultural identity shapes the attitudes of Hispanic youth towards engaging.  Further, attitudes toward food movement involvement and educating others positively impacts youth intentions to engage. Hispanic youth's attitudes toward protecting the authenticity of food and culture serve as an additional influential factor for engaging in the food movement and advocating for food justice. Social pressure from family and peers significantly impacts the food choices and cultural engagement of Hispanic youth. Food system knowledge and awareness contributes to youth attitudes towards the food movement and food and cultural heritage. Lack of knowledge can potentially impede engagement. Lastly, self-efficacy concerning the food movement acts as both a facilitator and inhibitor to youth engagement. However, cultural identity and familial support serve as factors which boost the confidence levels of Hispanic youth to engage in the food movement and food heritage.\",","27750":"\"description-degree\": \"MSLFS\",","27751":"\"description-provenance\": [","27752":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-20T08:00:38Z (GMT).

An original theory, Transformative Materiality, posits that landscape experience may be heightened, making people more aware of and engaged with their surroundings, if design encourages the changing of materials over time through temporal landscape processes (such as erosion and deposition). Resulting landscape phenomena may translate into passive education about the effects of naturalistic material transformation. And any gained experiential knowledge of the landscape, might, in turn, become a source of meaningful, personal connection to the landscape, potentially inspiring appreciation and stewardship. The theoretical development and argumentation for Transformative Materiality is preceded by its application in the final thesis design project, to provide a basis for common reference.

A putative resistant (R) mouse-ear population was assessed for ALS resistance relative to a putative susceptible (S) and a susceptible lab population Columbia (C). Results indicated that the R population needed 23 to >2400 fold rate of thifensulfuron relative to S or C population, and it has evolved cross-resistance to sulfonylureas (SU), triazolopyrimidine sulfonanilides (TP), and sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones (SCT). Further studies sequenced the whole genome for four field populations, representing two locations and two resistance levels (high and low) per location, to characterize the genetic mechanism of ALS resistance. The results revealed that all populations contained mutations in the ALS gene at the Pro197 site, although the Pro was substituted by Phe in one location and Thr in the other. Also, both high- and low-level resistant plants at one location had additional mutations (Trp574Leu or Asp376Glu) known to confer resistance to ALS inhibiting herbicides. Patterns of herbicide cross-resistance also varied among the populations. Additionally, research was conducted to assess preemergent (PRE) and postemergent (POST) alternative herbicide options for control of ALS resistant mouse-ear cress and its interference with winter wheat. Results indicate flumioxazin, pyroxasulfone, and metribuzin can be used for effective PRE control whereas 2,4-D, dicamba, and metribuzin can be effective post control options. No mouse-ear cress interference with winter wheat was observed at density of more than 300 plants m-2.\",","27844":"\"description-degree\": \"MSLFS\",","27845":"\"description-provenance\": [","27846":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-21T08:00:40Z (GMT).

Specifically, coal and mixed mineral mine dust, as well as, diesel particulate matter (DPM). These particulates have historically, and continue to have, significant health impacts on underground miners. Chapters 1 and 2 of this thesis concentrate on using a novel method of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to characterize respirable coal and mixed mineral mine dust and presents the results of this method being applied to samples collected in Appalachia coal mines. Appalachia has been a geographic \\"hotspot\\" for the rise in occupational lung disease amongst underground coal miners, which began in 1990's after decades of steady decline. This has led researchers to propose there could be something unique about the respirable dust composition in Appalachia coal mines, which resulted in the surge of lung disease cases; however, the knowledge base regarding the actual composition of respirable coal mine dust is limited. The results of this thesis show that most of the mass fraction of respirable Appalachia coal mine dust is not coal, but rather carbonates and non-carbonate minerals (i.e. silica and silicates). These findings are significant as many researchers now suspect silica and silicates to be the true culprit in the occupational lung disease of coal miners.  DPM presents an additional occupational health hazard to underground coal miners where diesel equipment is used and is difficult to monitor due to its complex nature. In underground metal/non-metal mines, airborne DPM is regulated and monitored using carbon surrogates. However, due to the potential interference from coal-sourced carbon, DPM in coal mines is monitored only by taking samples at the tailpipe of each piece of equipment. This thesis aims to investigate the potential for a laser-based instrument, the FLIR Airtec, to be used in underground coal mines.

Completely inactive and passive HT has implications on metabolic responses and subsequent performance during the initial phases of the second half. PURPOSEDetermine the effects of an active rewarm-up, compared to a passive period, at halftime on various measures of performance during the first 15-minutes of the second half using global positioning system (GPS) units. Identify the effects of the active versus passive HT period, with CHO beverage supplementation, on blood parameters. METHODSCrossover design study, twenty collegiate male soccer players participated in two 90-minute soccer matches with passive rest (CON) or a moderate-intensity rewarm-up (RWU) during HT with CHO supplementation. Subjects received five fingerstick blood samples throughout the match (BG) and four subjects had serum insulin/BG taken three times during the match. RESULTSRWU had significantly (p<0.05) higher measures for total distance, average speed, speed exertion, accelerations, HMP distance, decelerations, and EE during TI-4 half when compared to CON. No subjects experienced hypoglycemia. However, CON did have a significant drop in BG after HT and the lowest mean BG taken at 60-minutes. Tendency for CON and RWU to have HT insulin levels that were elevated and reduced, respectively. CONCLUSIONA passive HT period is not optimal, given its causal role in temporary physical performance deficits in the second half of soccer matches. The results provide a strong rationale for collegiate soccer players and teams to incorporate the 8-minute RWU into the HT regime to optimize second half performance.\",","28027":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28028":"\"description-provenance\": [","28029":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-09-28T08:00:47Z (GMT).

It presents a concept idea for a section of Downtown Blacksburg, Virginia that meets the various planning goals for the community. It also experiments with an innovative way of presenting and fostering discussion around this kind of vision by inviting stakeholders to experience models of the concept in an immersive three dimensional environment.  Common negative perceptions of density lead to resistance to increased density projects by the public and elected representatives. While there seems to be a consensus of understanding that denser development is preferable to sprawl, Americans in communities across the country have been resisting efforts to increase density. In Blacksburg higher density is often met with fear of student housing located too close to single family neighborhoods. Density resistance is rooted largely in the lack of general knowledge of what density looks like, how it is built, and how it feels once built. The negative aspects of high density neighborhoods, which have caused fearful reactions, are results of poor design, not an inevitability caused by density.  This thesis uses two approaches to argue for the advantages of higher density development. Methods include background research of densification elsewhere, a neighborhood redevelopment proposal, and a research event in which a select group of participants completed surveys, viewed presentations of 3D computer models of virtual developments in Blacksburg, and discussed their opinions and thoughts about the models and proposal. This project has demonstrated that 3D modeling is a more effective planning tool for helping decision-makers perceive density and understand the value of quality designs than typical planning tools based on 2D presentations.\",","28164":"\"description-degree\": \"MURPL\",","28165":"\"description-provenance\": [","28166":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-04T06:00:28Z (GMT).

The form of the house unfolds from the order of an overarching cruciform structure, dividing the space into four quadrants, which are further bisected by a horizontal plane producing a total of eight cubic spaces.

When receivers operate in the non-linear region, this will affect the system performance due to intermodulation products, and cross-modulation, to name a few. Intermodulation products are the result of adjacent channel signals that combine and create intermodulation distortion of the received signal. We call these adjacent channel signals blockers. Receiving blockers are unavoidable in wideband receivers and their effect must be analyzed and properly addressed. This M.S. Thesis studies the effect of blockers on system performance, specifically the symbol error rate (SER), as a function of the receiver non-linearity figure and the blocking signal power and modulation format. There have been numerous studies on the effect of non-linearity in the probability of true and false detections in spectrum sensing when blockers are present. There has also been research showing the optimal modulation scheme for effective jamming. However, we are not aware of work analyzing the effect of modulated adjacent channel blockers on communication system performance. The approach taken in this paper is a theoretical derivation followed by numerical analysis aimed to quantify the effect of receiver nonlinearity on communication system performance as a function of (1) receiver characteristics, (2) blocking signal powers, (3) signal and blocker modulation format, and (4) phase-synchronized/non-synchronized blocker reception. The work focuses on M-PSK modulation schemes. For high blocker powers and non-linearity, the Es/No (Eb/No) performance loss can be as high as 4.7 dB for BPSK modulated signal and BPSK modulated blockers when received in sync with the desired signal. When blockers have a random phase offset with respect to the desired signal, the performance degradation is about 2 dB for BPSK modulated desired and blocker signals. It was found that for an BPSK transmitted signal with phase-synchronous blockers, the SER (BER) deteriorates the most when the blocking signals are of the same modulation. The effect is reduced, but still significant, as the modulation order of the signal of interest or the blockers, or both increases.\",","28294":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28295":"\"description-provenance\": [","28296":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-04T08:01:14Z (GMT).

Volatile markets pose increased risks for the agricultural market participants and create a need for reliable price forecasts. Research discussed in this paper aims to find different approaches to forecast crop cash prices based on the prices of related futures contracts. Corn, soybeans, soft red winter wheat, and cotton are the focus of this research. Since price data for these commodities is non-stationary, this paper used two approaches to solve this problem. The first approach is to forecast the difference in prices between current and future period and the second is to use the regimes. This paper considers the five-year moving average approach as the benchmark when comparing these approaches. This research evaluated model performance using R-squared, mean errors, root mean squared errors, the modified Diebold-Mariano test, and the encompassing test. The results show that both the difference model and the regime model render better performance than the benchmark in most cases, but without a significant difference between each other.  Based on these findings, the regime model was used to make forecasts of the cash prices of corn and soybeans, the difference model was used to make predictions for cotton, and the benchmark was used to forecast the SRW cash price.\",","28340":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28341":"\"description-provenance\": [","28342":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-04T08:01:21Z (GMT).

The development from the rural to urban life and the journey to an urban civilization has left the city in tatters. It has had adverse impacts on both social and environmental frontiers. Such rapid growth has led to the uncontrolled growth of population in countries that are in the process of development, and this growth is interpreted by means of concrete structuring with no apparent thought given to fundamentals such as feasibility, aesthetics, health, safety, road network or transportation. This leaves a very small window for even accommodating places for recreation in unplanned cities. Such spaces use shared spaces for recreation. Spaces like markets or public squares or streets. The cultural heritage of India lies solely in its old cities, towns and ancient settlements. Due to globalization and groundbreaking pace of urbanization in the recent times, the historic fabric has been radically altered. As cities have evolved through aspirations and ideas only, with no functional thought whatsoever, it is vital for a developing country like India to recognize that without regard for its heritage it cannot build a future, or that a development without its heritage would be only unsustainable.\",","28424":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28425":"\"description-provenance\": [","28426":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-05T08:00:33Z (GMT).

With thousands of these stores built, many are being abandoned by their tenants who are relocating to new locations, following market demand and other factors. While current methods of re-using these buildings exist, they're inefficient and require huge amounts of time and money to redevelop effectively. This leads many to simply be demolished and create thousands of tons of debris for our landfills and wastes the embedded energy they have. Looking closely at a local shopping center going through a massive redevelopment process that will take years if not decades to complete, I propose an alternative method of developing the site in a shorter time frame. This method applies new construction techniques in modular building to facilitate a fundamental shift in what the site provides to the public. Transitioning from a retail only destination that requires a car to access and use into a fully walkable and engaging neighborhood with retail, residential, and commercial uses all contributing to the balance for its residents and visitors. All of this development acknowledges the fact that the success of this community will spur more development, and allows for that future growth. The dis-assembly of the modular constructs allows them to move and develop another shopping center else ware to continue improving our communities.\",","28469":"\"description-degree\": \"MARCH\",","28470":"\"description-provenance\": [","28471":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-05T08:01:18Z (GMT).

However, recently, microscopic simulation models have become a more popular tool for this purpose. The objectives of this study are to model multiple evacuation scenarios and to compare the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic simulation model against the MATSim mesoscopic model. Given that the demand was the same for both models, the comparison was achieved based on three indicatorsestimated evacuation time, average trip duration, and average trip distance. The results show that the estimated evacuation times in both models are close to each other since the Origin-Destination input file has a long tail distribution and so the majority of the evacuation time is associated when travelers evacuate and not the actual evacuation times. However, the evaluation also shows a considerable difference between the two models in the average trip duration. The average trip duration using INTEGRATION increases with increasing traffic demand levels and decreasing roadway capacity. On the other hand, the average trip duration using MATSim decreases with increasing traffic demand and decreasing the roadway capacity. Finally, the average trip distance values were significantly different in both models. The conclusion showed that the INTEGRATION model is more realistic than the MATSim model for evacuation purposes. The study concludes that despite the large execution times of a microscopic traffic simulation, the use of microsimulation is a worthwhile investment.\",","28511":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28512":"\"description-provenance\": [","28513":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-09T22:46:16Z (GMT).

The framework consists of (i) thermal modeling using 3D finite element analysis (FEA), (ii) surrogate modeling using functional Gaussian process, and (iii) Bayesian calibration using the thermal imaging data. Based on heat transfer laws, I first investigate the transient thermal behavior during AM using 3D FEA. A functional Gaussian process-based surrogate model is then constructed to reduce the computational costs from the high-fidelity, physically-based model. I finally employ a Bayesian calibration method, which incorporates the surrogate model and thermal measurements, to enable layer-to-layer thermal field prediction across the whole component.  A case study on fused deposition modeling is conducted for components with 7 to 16 layers. The cross-validation results show that the proposed framework allows for accurate and fast thermal field prediction for components with different process settings and geometric designs.\",","28563":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"This paper aims to achieve the layer to layer temperature monitoring and consequently predict the temperature distribution for any new freeform geometry. An engineering statistical synergistic model is proposed to integrate the pure statistical methods and finite element modeling (FEM), which is physically meaningful as well as accurate for temperature prediction. Besides, this proposed synergistic model contains geometry information, which can be applied to any freeform geometry. This paper serves to enable a holistic cyber physical systems-based approach for the additive manufacturing (AM) not only restricted in fused deposition modeling (FDM) process but also can be extended to powder-based process like laser engineered net shaping (LENS) and selective laser sintering (SLS). This paper as well as the scheduled future works will make it affordable for customized AM including customized geometries and materials, which will greatly accelerate the transition from rapid prototyping to rapid manufacturing. This article demonstrates a first evaluation of engineering statistical synergistic model in AM technology, which gives a perspective on future researches about online quality monitoring and control of AM based data fusion principles.\",","28564":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28565":"\"description-provenance\": [","28566":"\"Authorljingr@vt.edu\",","28567":"\"Provide open and immediate access to the ETD\",","28568":"\"I hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and submitted with my ETD a   \t\t\t\twritten permission statement from the ower(s) of each third part copyrighted matter to be included   \t\t\t\tin my thesis or dissertation, allowing distribution as specified above.  \t\t\t\t I certify that the version I submitted is the same as that approved by my advisory committee.\",","28569":"\"Submitted by Jingran Li (ljingr@vt.edu) on 2017-10-12T13:42:31Z No. of bitstreams2 license_rdf914 bytes, checksum2b2ab6ec8a6a222739b9c0e57c635c2e (MD5) Li_J_T_2017.pdf2761840 bytes, checksum6c10b1713493babe39950bc60a54c777 (MD5)\",","28570":"\"Approved for entry into archive by Priscilla Wright (pkwright@vt.edu) on 2017-10-12T13:57:41Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams2 license_rdf914 bytes, checksum2b2ab6ec8a6a222739b9c0e57c635c2e (MD5) Li_J_T_2017.pdf2761840 bytes, checksum6c10b1713493babe39950bc60a54c777 (MD5)\",","28571":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-12T14:02:49Z (GMT).

When exploring an idea for a thesis, I wanted to find design solutions for many of the problems associated with housing and the changing space needs or requirements throughout one's family life-cycle.   For over a century the single family home with the nuclear family has been the quintessential American cultural housing ideal. (Think of all the suburban developments and houses with perfectly manicured lawns and identical rows of winding streets stretching for miles and miles out into the countryside). However, in my opinion, this form of housing is quite wasteful in terms of space, material, family, and community resources. It segregates and separates us from our extended family reserves, costing us money, time and most importantly the daily support we might otherwise have from those closest to usfamily.   I recognize that I am proposing rethinking longstanding cultural understandings about our most basic everyday functionswhere and how we live.  Part of my architectural exploration includes a question that I know I can never fully answer in these pagescan design lead culture?

The role and the function of in-lieu fee (ILF) programs in supporting this regulatory structure have undergone a substantial change. For the first time in the history of the Sec. 404 program, 33 CFR Part 332 and 40 CFR Part 230, Subpart J (the \\"2008 mitigation rule\\" or \\"rule\\"), prioritizes the use of off-site mitigation over on-site-mitigation. Additionally, the rule prioritizes advanced, third-party mitigation; especially as achieved through mitigation banks; over any off-site compensatory mitigation provided by ILF programs (33 CFR 332.3(b)(1)). This new regulatory environment favors the use of commercial mitigation bank credits while acknowledging that the limited permittee demand of off-site mitigation credits, in particular areas, justifies the continuing need for ILF programs (Corps and EPA 2008, p.19606,19611). This research examines how regulatory officials use ILF programs under the 2008 mitigation rule, and, it determines the extent to which ILF programs are capable of fulfilling the role envisioned for them under the 2008 mitigation rule. Simulation results indicate that commercial mitigation banks cannot meet risk adjusted returns under limited credit demand conditions. ILF programs offer some additional financial capacity to fill the void in commercial bank coverage; but, this potential is limited in low demand conditions. Furthermore, empirical case studies of a Virginia and Georgia provide evidence that regulatory officials rely on ILF programs to provide off-site compensatory mitigation almost exclusively in the absence of private credit supply, as intended in the 2008 rule. Evidence in Georgia and Virginia also indicate that, in some situations, ILF programs face difficulties in providing mitigation under the constraints of limited demand and more stringent regulatory requirements.\",","28741":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28742":"\"description-provenance\": [","28743":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-17T08:01:07Z (GMT).

Monasteries were later established to accommodate travelers, the indigent and the sick.  Hospitals were constructed next to Religious institutions but also utilized house calls for the wealthy class. Monasteries were also organized in cloisters which were places of retreats from the mundane.  The idea of hospitals today is to diagnose, treat and heal patients which has proven to be effective with most diseases being prevented and eradicated entirely from our day to day lives. However, these conditions aren't as similar in Malawi.  The origin of the word hospital is derived from the Latin word \\"hospitalia\\" meaning a place of refuge for guests and strangers.

Wetting was analyzed with the sessile drop method, which observed the initial contact angle and change in contact angle over 35s. Penetration was measured within each individual tracheid. The Lucas-Washburn equation analyzed the wetting and penetration by calculating the penetration and comparing it to the measured penetration.  Wetting of four resins was compared on 3 species, to improve the understanding of adhesive wetting behavior. This study agreed with previous research, that the non-aqueous resin exhibited favorable wetting and presumably better penetration than aqueous resins, with exception of urea-formaldehyde.  Wetting and penetration of pMDI was studied on 5 wood species using the Lucas-Washburn equation. The wetting behaviors exhibited grain and species effects, which had implications on the resin availability for flake/strand-based composite products. The greater surface energy of loblolly pine most likely accounted for the significantly greater penetration of loblolly pine compared to Douglas-fir. The calculated penetration, via the Lucas-Washburn equation, exceeded the measured penetration, but it was concluded that the Lucas-Washburn equation predicted penetration reasonably well. Wetting and penetration of phenol-formaldehyde and subsequent adhesives was compared on 3 wood species using the Lucas-Washburn equation. All contact angles were unfavorable due to a skin formation. The Lucas-Washburn equation did not predict any penetration; however, penetration was observed with all systems.

Using a large collection of unlabeled videos, we train the CNN to predict the missing pixels of a spatiotemporal hole given the remaining parts of the video through minimizing per-pixel reconstruction loss. To achieve good reconstruction results using color videos, the CNN needs to have a certain level of understanding of the scene dynamics and predict plausible, temporally coherent contents. We further explore to jointly reconstruct both color frames and flow fields. By exploiting the statistical temporal structure of images, we show that the learned representations capture meaningful spatiotemporal structures from raw videos. We validate the effectiveness of our approach for CNN pre-training on action recognition and action similarity labeling problems. Our quantitative results demonstrate that our method compares favorably against learning without external data and existing unsupervised learning approaches.\",","28914":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28915":"\"description-provenance\": [","28916":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-19T08:00:43Z (GMT).

They also cause increased secretions of proinflammatory cytokines in cell lines and vaginal inflammation in porcine models; but have not been evaluated for developmental immunotoxicity. We assessed immunotoxicity in-vitro with J774A.1 murine macrophage cell line by analyzing cytokine production and phagocytosis; and evaluated developmental immunotoxicity in CD-1 mice by analyzing antibody production. Additionally, because of the associations between gut microbiome dysbiosis and immune disease, we monitored changes in the microbiome as a result of ADBAC+DDAC exposure. Production of cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 increased at low ADBAC+DDAC concentrations, and IL-10 decreased in the murine macrophages with ADBAC+DDAC exposure. The phagocytic function of macrophages was also severely decreased. ADBAC+DDAC altered the mouse microbiome by decreasing the relative abundance of Bacteroides and increases in Clostridia in F0 and F1 generations. IgG primary and secondary responses were altered in F1 male mice; and IgA and IgM production were decreased in secondary response in F2 male mice.  Since ADBAC+DDAC show signs of immunotoxicity in mice, further studies are needed to reassess risk for human exposure as ADBAC+DDAC may be contributing to immune disease.\",","28997":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","28998":"\"description-provenance\": [","28999":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-20T08:00:14Z (GMT).

The three challenges to be solved are - finding the right optimal order to tour the neighborhoods, determining entry and exit points to neighborhoods, and covering each neighborhood. Two approaches have been explored and compared to achieve this goal - a TSP - Greedy and TSP - Dijkstra's. Both of them use a TSP solution to determine the optimal order of touring. They also use the same back and forth motion to cover each region. However, while the first approach uses a brute force to determine the the next closest node of entry or exit, the second approach utilizes the Dijkstra's algorithm to compute all possible paths to every node in the graph, and therefore choose the shortest pairs of entry and exit for each region, that would generate the shorter path, overall. The main contribution of this work is to implement an existing algorithm to combine the touring and covering problem, and propose a new algorithm to perform the same. Empirical results comparing performances of both approaches are included. Hardware experiments are performed on a spraying hexacopter, using the TSP - Greedy approach. Unique system characteristics are studied to make conclusions about stability of the platform. Future directions are identified to improve both software and hardware performance.\",","29041":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29042":"\"description-provenance\": [","29043":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-21T08:00:17Z (GMT).

In 2017 there are approximately one million residential solar PV installations in the US. A significant share of these installations are downstream of distribution transformers and thus connected to the secondary. To precisely analyze voltage variations induced by PV systems into distribution systems, accurate models of load and PV systems connected to the secondary side of distribution transformers are required. In the work here we consider two secondary circuit modeling approaches, simple secondary and detailed secondary models. In simple secondary models all loads and all PV generators below a distribution transformer are modeled as an aggregate load and an aggregate PV generator. In the detailed secondary models all loads and PV systems below the distribution transformers are modeled individually and secondary conductors and service drops are also modeled. Using a cloud motion simulator, it is observed that employing the simple secondary models can lead to inaccurate and conservative results. Moreover, the locations with the greatest voltage changes are different in the two modeling approaches. This paper highlights the importance of utilizing detailed secondary models over simple secondary models in analyzing PV generation.\",","29189":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29190":"\"description-provenance\": [","29191":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-27T08:00:29Z (GMT).

One such evolution was the advent of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). With the introduction of PMUs in the field, power system monitoring and control changed for the better. Innovative and efficient algorithms that used synchrophasors came to be written. To make these algorithms robust, it became necessary to remove errors that crept into the power system with time and usage. Thus the process of calibration became essential when practical decisions started being made based on PMU measurements.    In the context of this thesis \u2018calibration\u2019 is the method used to estimate a correction factor which, when multiplied with the respective measurement, negates the effect of any errors that might have crept into them due to the instrument transformers located at the inputs of a PMU or the PMU device itself. Though this thesis mainly deals with the calibration of instrument transformers, work has been done previously for calibrating other components of a power system. A brief description of those methods have been provided along with a history on instrument transformer calibration.    Three new methodologies for instrument transformer calibration have been discussed in details in this thesis. The first method describes how only voltage transformers can be calibrated by placing optimal number of good quality voltage measurements at strategic locations in the grid, in presence of ratio errors in the instrument transformers and Gaussian errors in the PMUs. The second method provides a way to calibrate all instrument transformers (both current and voltage) in presence of only one good quality voltage measurement located at the end of a tie-line. This method assumes that all the instrument transformers have ratio errors and the PMUs have quantization errors. The third method attains the same objective as the second one, with the additional constraint that the data obtained from the field may be contaminated. Thus, the third method shows how calibration of all the instrument transformers can be done with data that is intermittent and is therefore, the most practical approach (of the three) for instrument transformer calibration.\",","29235":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29236":"\"description-provenance\": [","29237":"\"Authorpchatt24@vt.edu\",","29238":"\"Provide open and immediate access to the ETD\",","29239":"\"I hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and submitted with my ETD a   \t\t\t\twritten permission statement from the ower(s) of each third part copyrighted matter to be included   \t\t\t\tin my thesis or dissertation, allowing distribution as specified above.  \t\t\t\t I certify that the version I submitted is the same as that approved by my advisory committee.\",","29240":"\"Submitted by Janice Austin (jamarti1@vt.edu) on 2017-10-27T20:39:05Z  No. of bitstreams1  Chatterjee_P_T_2015.pdf3595832 bytes, checksum322eb2c4ff70894ffcf44fab691760a8 (MD5)\",","29241":"\"Approved for entry into archive by Janice Austin (jamarti1@vt.edu) on 2017-10-27T20:42:47Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams1  Chatterjee_P_T_2015.pdf3595832 bytes, checksum322eb2c4ff70894ffcf44fab691760a8 (MD5)\",","29242":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-10-30T13:42:08Z (GMT).

In engineering, sonar is the dominating modality for underwater sensing. In biology, it is likely to have been a central factor behind the unprecedented evolutionary success of bats, a highly diverse group that accounts for over 20% of all mammal species. However, it remains unclear to what extent engineered and biosonar follow similar design and operational principles. In the current work, the key sonar design characteristic of beamwidth is examined in technical and biosonar. To this end, beamwidth data has been obtained for 23 engineered sonar systems and from numerical beampattern predictions for 151 emission and reception elements (noseleaves and pinnae) from bat biosonar. Beamwidth data from these sources is compared to the beamwidth of a planar ellipsoidal transducer as a reference. The results show that engineered and biological both obey the basic physical limit on beamwidth as a function of the ratio of aperture size and wavelength. However, beyond that, the beamwidth data revealed very different behaviors between the engineered and the biological sonar systems. Whereas the beamwidths of the technical sonar systems were very close to the planar transducer limit, the biological samples showed a very wide scatter away from this limit. This scatter was as large \ufffd\\" if not wider \ufffd\\" than what was seen in a small reference data set obtained with random aluminum cones. A possible interpretation of these differences in the variability could be that whereas sonar engineers try to minimize beamwidth subject to constraints on device size, the evolutionary optimization of bat biosonar beampatterns has been directed at other factors that have left beamwidth as a byproduct. Alternatively, the biosonar systems may require beamwidth values that are larger than the physical limit and differ between species and their sensory ecological niches.\",","29334":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29335":"\"description-provenance\": [","29336":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-01T08:00:27Z (GMT).

When safety measures are limited to road closures, vehicles affected by the flooding have an origin, destination, or path segment that is closed or soon-to-be flooded during the trip's duration. This thesis introduces a framework to provide routing assistance and trip cancellation recommendations to affected vehicles. The framework relies on the connected vehicle environment for real-time link performance measures and flood data and evaluates the trip of the vehicle to determine whether it is affected by the flood or not. If the vehicle is affected and can still leave its origin, the framework generates the corresponding routing assistance in the form of hyperpath(s) or set of alternative paths. On the other hand, a vehicle with a closed origin receives a warning to wait at origin, while a vehicle with an affected destination is assigned to a new safe one. This framework is tested on two transportation networks. The evaluation of the framework's scalability to different network sizes and the sensitivity of the results to various flood characteristics, policy-related variables and other dependencies are performed using simulated vehicle data and hypothetical flood scenarios. The computation times depends on the network size and flood depth but have generally an average of 1.47 seconds for the largest tested network and deepest tested flood. The framework has the potential to alleviate the impacts and inconveniences associated with flooding.\",","29377":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29378":"\"description-provenance\": [","29379":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T08:00:24Z (GMT).

Additionally, it helps material producers to design, manufacture, test, and modify a polymeric material more rapidly. In the case of polymeric pipes, previous studies have shown that there are two possible time-dependent failure mechanisms corresponding to ductile and brittle failure. The ductile mechanism is evident at shorter times-to-failure and results from the stretching of the amorphous region under loading and the subsequent plastic deformation. Empirical results show that many high-performance polyethylene (PE) materials do not exhibit the brittle failure mechanism. Hence, it is critical to understand the ductile mechanism and find an approach to predict the corresponding times-to-failure using accelerated means. The aim of this study is to develop an innovative rupture lifetime acceleration protocol for PE pipes which is sensitive to the structure, orientation, and morphology changes introduced by changing processing conditions. To accomplish this task, custom fixtures are developed to admit tensile and hoop burst tests on PE pipes. A pressure modified Eyring flow equation is used to predict the rupture lifetime of PE pipes using the measured mechanical properties under axial tensile and hydrostatic pressure loading in different temperatures and strain rates. In total, the experimental method takes approximately one week to be completed and allows the prediction of pipe lifetimes for service lifetime in excess of 50 years.\",","29422":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29423":"\"description-provenance\": [","29424":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:44Z (GMT).

Caesar is able to achieve near-perfect availability, provide high performance - low latency and high throughput compared to the existing state-of-the- art, and tolerate replica failures. Recently, a number of state-of-the-art consensus protocols that implement the Generalized Consensus definition have been proposed. However, the major limitation of these existing approaches is the significant performance degradation when application workload produces conflicting requests. Caesar's main goal is to overcome this limitation by changing the way a fast decision is takenits ordering protocol does not reject a fast decision for a client request if a quorum of nodes reply with different dependency sets for that request. It only switches to a slow decision if there is no chance to agree on the proposed order for that request. Caesar is able to achieve this using a combination of wait condition and logical time stamping. The effectiveness of Caesar is demonstrated through an evaluation study performed on Amazon's EC2 infrastructure using 5 geo-replicated sites. Caesar outperforms other multi-leader (e.g., EPaxos) competitors by as much as 1.7x in presence of 30% conflicting requests, and single-leader (e.g., Multi-Paxos) by as much as 3.5x. The protocol is also resistant to heavy client loads unlike existing protocols.\",","29477":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29478":"\"description-provenance\": [","29479":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:44Z (GMT).

In a two-group study of international (n = 20) and domestic (n = 20) families, we sought to determine whether parental and cultural factors could differentially predict children's tendency to disclose, withhold, or mask internalizing (i.e., anxiety and depression) symptoms. Caregivers completed a battery of measures while children completed self-report questionnaires and an interactive activity to assess disclosure propensity. Results indicate that parenting and attitudinal factors are not necessarily implicated in predicting children's decisions for both anxiety and depression, and irrespective of cultural background. However, among international families, children's inclination toward disclosure of anxiety-related concerns reflected significant cultural influences (Wilks' \u03bb = .386, Chi-square = 15.230, df = 6, Canonical correlation = .729, p = .019). Caregiver acculturation in particular was found to account for 84.2% of the variance, with children of less acculturated parents being more likely to mask as opposed to disclose or withhold.\",","29580":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29581":"\"description-provenance\": [","29582":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:45Z (GMT).

The nonlinear equations are solved on a fine grid and the linear equations are solved on a corresponding coarsened grid. Mapping operators execute data transfer between the grids. The CGP framework is constructed upon spatial and temporal discretization schemes. This framework has been established for finite volume/difference discretizations as well as explicit time integration methods. In this article we present for the first time a version of CGP for finite element discretizations, which uses a semi-implicit time integration scheme. The mapping functions correspond to the finite-element shape functions. With the novel data structure introduced, the mapping computational cost becomes insignificant. We apply CGP to pressure correction schemes used for the incompressible Navier Stokes flow computations. This version is validated on standard test cases with realistic boundary conditions using unstructured triangular meshes. We also pioneer investigations of the effects of CGP on the accuracy of the pressure field. It is found that although CGP reduces the pressure field accuracy, it preserves the accuracy of the pressure gradient and thus the velocity field, while achieving speedup factors ranging from approximately 2 to 30. Exploring the influence of boundary conditions on CGP, the minimum speedup occurs for velocity Dirichlet boundary conditions, while the maximum speedup occurs for open boundary conditions. We discuss the CGP method as a guide for partial mesh refinement of incompressible flow computations and show its application for simulations of flow over a backward facing step and flow past a cylinder.\",","29632":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29633":"\"description-provenance\": [","29634":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:45Z (GMT).

Beginning with an analysis of early twentieth-century postcards, this study establishes the foundational elements of the hillbilly archetype as a symptom of class-based prejudice and explores how these key elements are visible in online memes, with particular attention to the genre of 'Trump Voter' memes that emerged as a response to the 2016 United States presidential campaign.

In this thesis, an algorithm for predicting the trajectory of a small, fixed-wing UAS using an estimate of its orientation and for maneuvering around the threat, if necessary, is developed. A computer vision algorithm locates specific feature points of a threat aircraft in an image and the POSIT algorithm uses these feature points to estimate the pose (position and attitude) of the threat. A sequence of pose estimates is then used to predict the trajectory of the threat aircraft and to avoid colliding with it. To assess the algorithm's performance, the predictions are compared with predictions based solely on position estimates for a variety of encounter scenarios. Simulation and experimental results indicate that trajectory prediction using orientation estimates provides quicker response to a change in the threat aircraft trajectory and results in better prediction and avoidance performance.\",","29733":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29734":"\"description-provenance\": [","29735":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:46Z (GMT).

This concept was likened to staves in a barrel, where the shortest stave determines the barrel's ability to hold water (Mitchell and Block, 1946). Inaccuracies in models that predict nutrient supply and requirements of dairy cows result in inefficient feeding, as under-prediction of requirements results in deficiency, and over-prediction results in excess. To avoid limitations in production due to AA deficiencies, protein is fed in quantities that likely exceed requirements. Overfeeding of AA results in increased expenses for producers and increased N excretion to the environment, providing economic and environmental incentives to increase N-efficiency. Work presented in the following chapters evaluated the impact of AA supplementation on milk production in dairy cattle, and evaluated the PREP10 and NRC (2001) nutrient requirement model predictions. In two feeding trials (Chapter 2 and Chapter 3), low protein diets did not result in decreased milk production, indicating that protein requirements were overestimated. Although supplementation of AA did not increase milk production, low protein diets resulted in greater N-efficiency, especially when supplemented with Histidine. Evaluation of the PREP10 and NRC (2001) models (Chapter 4) used production data from the literature to identify deficiencies in prediction equations, and found that correction of model bias would considerably reduce prediction errors. Model inaccuracies affect the inefficiency of dairy cow feeding, and must be evaluated to improve feed efficiency. Such improvements could act synergistically with AA supplementation to more closely match nutrient supply to requirements.\",","29783":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29784":"\"description-provenance\": [","29785":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:46Z (GMT).

One sustainable solution is full-depth reclamation (FDR), a pavement rehabilitation technique that involves pulverizing and reusing materials from existing distressed pavements in place. There is, however, limited information on the long-term properties of these recycled materials. One important property, the elastic modulus, indicates the structural capacity of pavement materials and is highly recommended for design purposes by the Mechanistic Empirical Pavements Design Guide (MEPDG). The elastic modulus directly impacts selection of the overall pavement thickness, and an accurate estimation of the modulus is therefore key to a cost-effective pavement design. This thesis researched the modulus trends and functional properties of three in-service pavements rehabilitated with the FDR technique during the 2008 Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) construction season. Foamed asphalt (2.7% with 1% cement), asphalt emulsion (3.5%), and Portland cement (5%) were used as stabilizing agents for the FDR layers. Several deflection tests and distress surveys were conducted for the pavement sections before and after construction. An automated road analyzer (ARAN) was used to collect distress data over a period of 7 years. Deterioration models were developed to predict the durability of differently stabilized FDR pavements and compared to reference sections rehabilitated with traditional asphalt concrete (AC) overlays. The results of the moduli measured for the recycled base materials varied significantly over time. These changes were attributed to curing after construction, seasonal effects, and subgrade moisture. The structural capacity of the pavements improved irrespective of the stabilizing agent used. Rutting was higher for the foamed asphalt and emulsion sections. The International Roughness Index (IRI) was better for the cement stabilized sections compared asphalt stabilized sections. The Critical Condition Index (CCI) was similar for all treatments at the end of the evaluation period. The durability of the sections was comparable, with the cement stabilized FDR sections slightly outperforming the asphalt stabilized sections.\",","29834":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29835":"\"description-provenance\": [","29836":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:46Z (GMT).

The primary aim of this research was to explore the impact of spin-class instruction style on mood among spin-class participants. In Study 1, research assistants (RAs) evaluated the instruction of spin-class instructors and administered mood surveys to spin-class participants and instructors. Overall, positive mood improved for all spin-class participants and instructors. Instruction style did not moderate this effect. In Study 2, a refined instruction evaluation form was used to better detect person-oriented vs. task-oriented instruction. Unlike in Study 1, RAs also completed mood surveys. Overall, positive mood improved as a function of the exercise class for spin-class members and instructors, but not for RAs. Instruction style did not moderate this mood effect. Overall, the results support prior research that exercise leads to mood improvement. However, an impact of instruction style on class participants' mood was not found. One novel approach of this study was that instruction style was not manipulated. This pragmatic approach allowed the research team to explore organic instructor-student dynamics in a spin-class, which may improve the generalizability of the findings.\",","29887":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29888":"\"description-provenance\": [","29889":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:46Z (GMT).

However, the specific behavioral and neural mechanisms by which nicotine influences the learning process is poorly understood. Here, we use a probabilistic learning task, functional magnetic resonance imaging and neurocomputational analyses, to show that chronic smoking is associated with higher reward sensitivity, along with lower learning rate and striatal prediction error signal. Further, we show that these effects do not differ between individuals with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, a negative correlation between reward sensitivity and striatal prediction error signal was found among smokers, consistent with the suggestion that enhanced tonic dopamine associated with increased reward sensitivity leads to an attenuation of phasic dopamine activity necessary for updating of reward value during learning.\",","29937":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","29938":"\"description-provenance\": [","29939":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-02T20:48:46Z (GMT).

Anxiety moderated the relationship between ASD severity and the social relations domain of quality of life. Anxiety symptoms did not, however, significantly moderate the effect on the psychological domain. Exploratory analyses also demonstrated significant indirect effects of ASD severity on social and psychological quality of life through anxiety symptoms. Results provide preliminary evidence that anxiety symptoms contribute to quality of life in adults with ASD independently of core ASD symptomatology.

Accordingly, there has been a number of Building Energy Management (BEM) software/hardware solutions to monitor energy consumption and other measurements of individual building loads. BEM software serves as a platform to implement smart control strategies and stores historical data. Although BEM software provides such lucrative benefits to building operators, in terms of energy savings and personalized control, these benefits are not harnessed by most small to mid-sized buildings due to a high cost of deployment and maintenance. A cloud-based BEM system can offer a low-cost solution to promote ease of use and support a maintenance-free installation.   In a typical building, a conventional router has a public address and assigns private addresses to all devices connected to it. This led to a network topology, where the router is the only device in the Internet space with all other devices forming an isolated local area network behind the router. Due to this scenario, a cloud-based BEM software needs to pass through the router to access devices in a local area network. To address this issue, some devices, during operation, make an outbound connection to traverse through the router and provide an interface to itself on the Internet. Hence, based on their capability to traverse through the router, devices in a local area network can be distinguished as cloud and non-cloud devices. Cloud-based BEM software with sufficient authorization can access cloud devices. In order to access devices adhering to non-cloud protocols, cloud-based BEM software requires a device in the local area network which can perform traversal through the router on behalf of all non-cloud devices. Such a device acts as an IoT gateway, to securely interconnect devices in a local area network with cloud-based BEM software.   This thesis focuses towards architecting, designing and prototyping an Internet-of-Things (IoT) gateway which can perform traversal on behalf of non-cloud devices. This IoT gateway enables cloud-based BEM software to have a comprehensive access to supported non-cloud devices. The IoT gateway has been designed to support BACnet, Modbus and HTTP RESTful, which are the three widely adopted communication protocols in the building automation and control domain.

This test rig was designed and built to study the performance of tires in off-road conditions on surfaces such as soil, sand, and ice. Understanding the braking performance of tires is crucial, especially for terrains like ice, which has a low coefficient of friction. Also, rolling resistance is one of the important aspects affecting the tractive performance of a vehicle and its fuel consumption. Investigating these experimentally will help improve tire models performance. The current configuration of the test rig does not have braking and free rolling capabilities. This study involves modifications on the rig to enable free rolling testing when the clutch is disengaged and to allow braking when the clutch is engaged and the brake applied. The first part of this work involves the design and fabrication of a clutch system that would not require major changes in the setup of the test rig; this includes selecting the appropriate clutch that would meet the torque requirement, the size that would fit in the space available, and the capability to be remotely operated. The test rig's carriage has to be modified in order to fit a pneumatic clutch, its adapter, a new transmission shaft, and the mounting frame for the clutch system. The components of the actuation system consisting of pneumatic lines, the pressure regulator, valves, etc., have to be installed. Easy operation of the clutch from a remote location is enabled through the installation of a solenoid valve. The second part of this work is to design, fabricate, and install a braking system. The main task is to design a customized braking system that satisfies the various physical and functional constraints of the current configuration of the Terramechanics rig. Some other tasks are the design and fabrication of a customized rotor, selection of a suitable caliper, and design and fabrication of a customized mounting bracket for the caliper. A hydraulic actuation system is selected since it is suitable for this configuration and enables remote operation of the brakes. Finally, the rig is upgraded with the assembly of these two systems onto it.\",","30168":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30169":"\"description-provenance\": [","30170":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-03T08:01:19Z (GMT).

Many acknowledge that medical staff regularly visit healing gardens to escape work-related stress (Marcus and Sachs, 2014).  Rarely, however, are healing gardens on medical campuses designed specifically to support physicians' well-being. There is a void in healing garden design theory. Reports on the prevalence of physician burnout, warn of a widespread crisis and dismal reality within the medical community (T. D. Shanafelt et al., 2015). Researchers pronounce an urgent need for evidence-based interventions, which address individual contributing factors to burnout (Christina Maslach, Jackson, and Leiter, 1986). By investigating the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program, an evidence-based therapy, clinically proven to cultivate emotional healing, for physicians suffering burnout, this research reveals how a therapeutic garden could meld mindfulness-based practices with environmental theory; healing garden design precedents; and healthcare design typologies. Finally, mindfulness-based landscape design guidelines describe how a private, restorative, healing garden could help maintain physicians' well-being and rehabilitate physicians experiencing burnout due to emotional exhaustion within the workplace.\",","30257":"\"description-degree\": \"MLA\",","30258":"\"description-provenance\": [","30259":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-04T08:00:16Z (GMT).

The total available wave energy resource for the United States alone is 2,640 TWh/yr; nearly two thirds of the 4,000 TWh of electricity used in the United States each year. It is estimated that nearly half of that available energy is recoverable through wave energy conversion techniques. In this thesis, a two-body 'point absorber' type wave energy converter with a mechanical power-takeoff is investigated. The two-body wave energy converter extracts energy through the relative motion of a floating buoy and a neutrally buoyant submerged body. Using a linear frequency-domain model, analytical solutions of the optimal power and the corresponding power-takeoff components are derived for the two-body wave energy converter. Using these solutions, a case study is conducted to investigate the influence of the submerged body size on the absorbed power of the device in regular and irregular waves. Here it is found that an optimal mass ratio between the submerged body and floating buoy exists where the device will achieve resonance. Furthermore, a case study to investigate the influence of the submerged body shape on the absorbed power is conducted using a time-domain numerical model. Here it is found that the submerged body should be designed to reduce the effects of drag, but to maintain relatively large hydrodynamic added mass and excitation force. To validate the analytical and numerical models, a 1/30th scale model of a two-body wave energy converter is tested in a wave tank. The results of the wave tank tests show that the two-body wave energy converter can absorb nearly twice the energy of a single-body 'point absorber' type wave energy converter.\",","30394":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30395":"\"description-provenance\": [","30396":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-10T09:00:38Z (GMT).

Katahdin (KT, n = 4), Suffolk (SU, n = 3), and Texel (TX, n = 3) rams were randomly mated to KT ewes over two years (Y1, Y2) at the Virginia Tech Southwest Agricultural Research and Extension Center. Post-lambing until weaning (80 d), pairs were managed on fescue pasture. At weaning, lambs (n = 192) were moved to an ungrazed pasture and provided a concentrate pellet daily for a 90 d grazing trial. During this time, BW, strongylid egg count (FEC), FAMACHA score and packed cell volume (PCV) were collected every 14 d. FAMACHA score - 3 was utilized as the basis for anthelmintic treatment. Post-grazing, lambs were fed to approximately 50 kg BW. Lambs were harvested at the Virginia Tech Meat Center and carcass evaluation performed 1 d post-harvest. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with Proc MIXED for repeated measures analysis and Proc GLM with Tukey?s test for mean separation. No differences existed between sire breeds for adjusted number of lambs born or number of lambs weaned. Adjusted birth BW was greater for SU-sired lambs than KT-sired and TX-sired (P < 0.05) in Y2. Adjusted weaning BW was smallest for KT-sired lambs compared to SU- and TX-sired lambs (P < 0.05) in both years. During the grazing trials, BW, ADG, lnFEC, FAMACHA and PCV varied over time (P < 0.001) with  lower FAMACHA scores for KT-sired lambs than SU- and TX-sired lambs in Y1 (P < 0.05).  A greater proportion of SU-sired lambs tended to require deworming than KT-sired lambs (P = 0.08). Adjusted BW post weaning was greater for TX-sired lambs than KT-sired lambs (P < 0.05) in Y1. Post-grazing, BW and ADG varied over time (P < 0.01) with no sire breed differences for ADG. At harvest, SU-sired lambs were heavier than KT-sired lambs (P < 0.05). TX-sired lambs had greater LM area than KT-sired lambs (P = 0.05). KT-sired lambs had the smallest leg scores (P < 0.05). These results indicate the potential of terminal sires (SU- and TX-sires) to improve lamb growth and carcass merit. TX-sired lambs had more similar parasite resistance characteristics to KT-sired Iambs and may have potential as terminal sires in forage based hair sheep production systems.\",","30440":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30441":"\"description-provenance\": [","30442":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-10T09:00:51Z (GMT).

Their gastrointestinal tract and feces naturally contain gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria express lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on their cell membranes, which is recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). In cases where epithelial barriers are compromised or breached LPS has the potential to enter circulation and cause the inflammatory symptoms seen with endotoxemia. The objective of this study was to determine TLR4 presence and functionality on equine B cells. TLR4 expression on B lymphocytes has been studied in mouse, human and many other mammals, but has not been well characterized in the horse. Humans are highly sensitive to LPS but their B cells express non-functional TLR4. Mice in contrast are highly tolerant of LPS yet their B cells express functional TLR4. Studies in horse have perhaps been limited by the limited array of antibody markers available for use in horse. Anti-human CD21 has previously been shown to mark equine B lymphocytes. We show rat anti-mouse CD45R(B220) mAbs also accurately labels equine B lymphocytes. To investigate TLR4 expression in horses 12 Thoroughbred geldings, ages 5-10, were used for blood collection. By using the density gradient, Lympholyte, lymphocytes were separated from peripheral blood and incubated with or without LPS. B lymphocyte proliferation, TLR4 expression and mRNA changes were examined before or after culture in the presence or absence of LPS. We demonstrate TLR4 is expressed on equine B lymphocytes through the use of a mouse anti-human TLR4 antibody, clone 76B357.1, not previously used in horse. We demonstrated equine B cells fail to proliferate under LPS challenge as opposed to highly proliferative mouse B lymphocytes. However, transcriptional changes were observed in the equine cells within the TLR4 pathway upon treatment with LPS.\",","30483":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30484":"\"description-provenance\": [","30485":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-10T09:00:58Z (GMT).

SCPL is a path loss model which characterizes the radio wave propagation in an environment by solely using Received Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprints. The propagation of the radio waves is characterized by uniformly dividing the environment into grid cells, followed by the estimation of the propagation parameters for each grid cell individually. By using SCPL and RSS fingerprints acquired at an unknown location, the distance between an agent and all the access point in an indoor environment can be determined. A least-squares based trilateration is then used as the global fix of location the agent in the environment. The result of the trilateration is then represented in a probability distribution function over the grid cells induced by SCPL. Since the proposed technique is able to locally model the propagation accounting for attenuation of non-uniform environmental irregularities, the characterization of the path loss in the indoor environment and radiolocation technique might yield improved results. The efficacy of the proposed technique was investigated with an experiment comparing SCPL and an indoor radiolocation technique based on a conventional path loss model.\",","30526":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"This thesis presents a technique uses radio waves to localize an agent in an indoor environment. By characterizing the difference between transmitted and received power of the radio waves, the agent can determine how far it is away from the transmitting antennas, i.e. access points, placed in the environment. Since the power difference mainly results from obstructions in the environment, the attenuation profile of the environment carries a significant importance in radiolocation techniques. The proposed technique, called Spatially Coherent Path Loss Model (SCPL), characterizes the radio wave propagation, i.e. the attenuation, separately for different regions of the environment, unlike the conventional techniques employing global attenuation profiles. The localization environment is represented with grid-cell structure and the parameters of SCPL model describing the extent of the attenuation of the environment are estimated individually. After creating an attenuation profile of the environment, the agent localizes itself in the localization environment by using SCPL with signal powers received from the access points. This scheme of attenuation profiling constitutes the main contribution of the proposed technique. The efficacy and validity of the proposed technique was investigated with an experiment comparing SCPL and an indoor radiolocation technique based on a conventional path loss model.\",","30527":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30528":"\"description-provenance\": [","30529":"\"AuthorAuthorAuthormurata@vt.edu\",","30530":"\"Provide open and immediate access to the ETD\",","30531":"\"I hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and submitted with my ETD a   \t\t\t\twritten permission statement from the ower(s) of each third part copyrighted matter to be included   \t\t\t\tin my thesis or dissertation, allowing distribution as specified above.  \t\t\t\t I certify that the version I submitted is the same as that approved by my advisory committee.\",","30532":"\"Submitted by Murat Ambarkutuk (murata@vt.edu) on 2017-11-15T14:52:40Z No. of bitstreams2 license_rdf1031 bytes, checksum72519bed840f81617dda6654b015f0a1 (MD5) Ambarkutuk_Murat_T_2017.pdf5767253 bytes, checksum28931aa987ff25f0263022e9a5d87c7d (MD5)\",","30533":"\"Approved for entry into archive by Priscilla Wright (pkwright@vt.edu) on 2017-11-15T15:03:12Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams2 license_rdf1031 bytes, checksum72519bed840f81617dda6654b015f0a1 (MD5) Ambarkutuk_Murat_T_2017.pdf5767253 bytes, checksum28931aa987ff25f0263022e9a5d87c7d (MD5)\",","30534":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-15T19:44:06Z (GMT).

IPM practices include pest-resistant variety; stale seedbed (sequential harrowing or harrowing followed by a non-selective herbicide); apply Trichoderma on seeds or seedlings, no insecticide spray for the first 40 days; apply bio-pesticides such as neem, Bt, and metarhizium, and Beauvaria; Sarcocystis bait for rodents; hand weeding at recommended growth stage; and/or another practice specified by the farmer.   Out of 394 farmers surveyed, 40 (10.15%) were found to be high adopters, 228 (57.86%) were found to be low adopters, and 126 (31.97%) were found to be non-adopters of IPM. IPM practices currently include mostly hand-weeding and no spray for 40 days; few other practices were adopted. Our study reveals a need for broader education on rice IPM throughout Cambodia. The high frequency of pesticide applications among rice farmers, the finding that adoption of IPM was not found to have a meaningful influence on the number of pesticide applications, and the finding that less than one-quarter of farmers in our study have received training on IPM reveal the need for increased knowledge of IPM in Cambodia, and the need for future education on IPM to focus on reducing pesticide use.\",","30573":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30574":"\"description-provenance\": [","30575":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-16T09:00:19Z (GMT).

Most cancer treatment and surgery today are performed using medical imaging. Medical imaging is therefore of great importance to the medical industry. Medical imaging continues to depend heavily on a series of 2D scans, resulting in a series of 2D photographs being displayed using light boxes and/or computer monitors.  Today, these 2D images are increasingly combined into 3D solid models using software.  These 3D models can be used for improved visualization and understanding of the problem at hand, including fabricating physical 3D models using additive manufacturing technologies. Generating precise 3D solid models automatically from 2D scans is non-trivial.  Geometric and/or topologic errors are common, and often costly manual editing is required to produce 3D solid models that sufficiently reflect the actual underlying human geometry.  These errors arise from the ambiguity of converting from 2D data to 3D data, and also from inherent limitations of the .STL fileformat used in additive manufacturing. This thesis proposes a new, robust method for automatically generating 3D models from 2D scanned data (e.g., computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), where the resulting 3D solid models are specifically generated for use with additive manufacturing.  This new method does not rely on complicated procedures such as contour evolution and geometric spline generation, but uses volume reconstruction instead. The advantage of this approach is that the original scan data values are kept intact longer, so that the resulting surface is more accurate. This new method is demonstrated using medical CT data of the human nasal airway system, resulting in physical 3D models fabricated via additive manufacturing.\",","30617":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30618":"\"description-provenance\": [","30619":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-11-17T09:00:15Z (GMT).

Obesity is related to development of diseases that are detrimental to performance and potentially fatal in horses, including insulin resistance, laminitis, and equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). Objectives of this research included first, characterization of nutrition-related management practices of hunter/jumper show industry via a voluntary survey; second, evaluating the Body Condition Index (BCI) in comparison to the Body Condition Scoring system (BCS) in sporthorses; and lastly, determining the effects of a hindgut buffer in overconditioned horses following an abruptly introduced moderate nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) meal. There were no differences in nutritional management between hunter and jumper disciplines and most representatives (n=89) had no nutritional concerns. Many used trainers (38%) and veterinarians (36%) as sources of nutritional advice rather than professional equine nutritionists (7%). BCI had consistently higher scores than BCS (P<0.01), with the largest differences in horses with BCS < 5. Horses were offered a concentrate meal containing 1.2g NSC/kg BW with and without DigestaWell\u00ae Buffer (DB). Horses receiving DB had decreased plasma L-lactate (P=0.05), and a tendency for increased fecal pH (P=0.08) and decreased fecal D-lactate (P=0.07). These studies demonstrate a need to improve horse owner education and the relationship between representatives and trained nutritionists to reduce disease incidence, that different equations may need to be developed for a more consistently accurate BCI across various breed and body types, and that DB may have a positive impact on the equine digestive response to NSC.\",","30660":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30661":"\"description-provenance\": [","30662":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-01T09:00:17Z (GMT).

An investigation of intact stability characteristics for multi-hulls along the continuum is presented and their trends are examined. Next, a series of trimaran configurations are modeled in CAD with subdivision to determine their allowable KG according to USN deterministic criteria and using quasi-static methods. A response surface model was determined for allowable KG as a function of center hull length to beam, side hull beam to draft, transverse position, and displacement for use as a rule of thumb measure and potential optimization constraint.\",","30702":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30703":"\"description-provenance\": [","30704":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-09T09:00:16Z (GMT).

Case studies on monitoring-based commissioning (MBCx) have shown that using energy management and information systems (EMIS) for continuous energy monitoring and analysis enables the identification of issues that cause energy waste and verifies energy conservation measures. However, MBCx is underutilized by organizations leading to an energy efficiency gap between the energy saving potential of technologies like EMIS and observed savings. This energy efficiency gap can be attributed to general barriers to MBCx and barriers caused specifically by cognitive bias in the decision-making process. Using qualitative data from over 40 organizations implementing and practicing MBCx, this manuscript provides a better understanding of these barriers. Chapter 1 synthesizes and codes the qualitative data to develop a framework of variables acting as barriers and enablers to MBCx. The framework highlights commonly experienced barriers like data configuration, and also variables with conflicting results like payback/return on investment, which was experienced as a barrier to some organizations and enabler to others. Chapter 2 examines the barriers to MBCx through a behavioral decision science lens and finds evidence of cognitive biases, specifically, risk aversion, social norms, choice overload, status quo bias, information overload, professional bias, and temporal discounting. The success of choice architecture in other energy efficiency decisions is used to offer suggestions for ways to overcome these cognitive biases. This manuscript can be used by practitioners to better understand potential barriers to MBCx and by researchers to prioritize gaps and find methods to overcome the barriers to MBCx.\",","30746":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30747":"\"description-provenance\": [","30748":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-09T09:00:23Z (GMT).

This thesis explores the potential for hypothermic machine perfusion in prolonging limb graft viability in a swine forelimb amputation model. The experiment was designed with the right and left forelimbs from the same pig randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups. Eighteen (18) limbs were procured from a local abattoir, vessels cannulated, and an initial flush of a modified phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was performed. Half of those limbs, assigned to the treatment group, were then preserved with continuous hypothermic machine perfusion for 12 hours. The perfusate was a PBS solution supplemented with 5% w/v dextrose. The remaining nine limbs, assigned to the control group, were placed into a plastic bag and kept at room temperature (ca. 20oC) for the entire duration of the experiment. Methylene blue was used to verify perfusion throughout limbs. Histopathological analysis revealed the presence of significantly greater deterioration of the perfused limbs compared to control. I concluded that PBS solution is not suitable for extended limb preservation. Inadequate perfusate volume and lack of solution replenishment resulted in metabolic waste build up, accelerating total organ damage. Continued research is needed in order to develop clinically relevant hypothermic machine perfusion devices capable of prolonged limb preservation.\",","30828":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","30829":"\"description-provenance\": [","30830":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2017-12-19T09:00:18Z (GMT).

To help meet this challenge, I have created three case-based modules that teach engineering students how to apply sustainability principles and help them recognize potential cognitive traps, or barriers, that may prevent more consideration for sustainability during design. Each of my three case studies is built into a PowerPoint-guided module for undergraduate engineering classes, which may be taught in 1-3 class days. I have implemented each of the three modules in senior-level classes at Virginia Tech, assessed survey data, and scored student assignments. This work and the underlying literature background is reflected in three journal papers, one for each module. My case study modules, along with all associated teaching materials, are shared in the Center for Sustainable Engineering repository for other instructors to adapt and use.  Each module includes a case study about an infrastructure project recognized and awarded by the Envision rating system, demonstrating a case of sustainability done well. Adaptable PowerPoint slides are used to teach about the Envision rating system and credits particularly relevant to the project. Active learning assignments allow students to apply the Envision framework and design criteria to complex and ill-structured problems related to the case study. Slides also cover the relation of three selected behavioral decision science concepts to each case study; these include cognitive biases and barriers which tend to inhibit sustainability outcomes, as well as some potential solutions to mitigate or overcome such barriers. Paired with the decision-making framework of Envision, awareness of these transdisciplinary concepts will allow students to more effectively manage the complex decisions found in real-world projects.  Results were assessed through a variety of methods to determine the modules' level of effectiveness in accomplishing defined student learning outcomes. Pre-module and post-module student surveys were employed to measure several indicatorschanges in self-assessed confidence levels, perceptions of sustainable design (characteristics and barriers), and accuracy of module concept definitions. Each of several active learning assignments was scored on a simple rubric. Concept maps were also tested as further type of assessment, and scored with both traditional and holistic methods. However, fully integrating the concept mapping approach is left to the future work of others.  These modules are a significant contribution to engineering education, as they integrate diverse topics and disciplines into a unified and relevant teaching package. Over 350 students have already been reached through the three modules, and sharing the materials in a peer-reviewed repository allows for expansion, adaptation, and capacity building. Each module's content and pedagogy align with ABET accreditation requirements and ASCE's Body of Knowledge, making them relevant tools for equipping the future generation of engineers.

The applications can be found at the auxiliary supplies in automobile, industrial and communication systems. Buck converter is a common circuit topology to fulfill step-down conversion, especially in low-power application since it is well-studied and straightforward. However, it suffers from low duty cycle under high step-down condition, and typically operates in continuous conduction mode (CCM) that generates large switching loss. On the other hand, as an extension of the buck converter, tapped-inductor (TI) buck converter has larger duty cycle while maintaining the structural simplicity. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to explore the potential of TI buck converter as a wide conversion range, high power density and high efficiency topology for low power application. To achieve high efficiency at switching frequency of MHz-level, synchronous conduction mode (SCM) is applied for turn-on losses elimination.  \tThe operation principle and power stage design of SCM TI buck is first introduced. The design of high switching frequency coupled inductor is emphasized since its size plays a critical role in power density. Loss breakdown is also provided to perform a comprehensive topological study. Secondly, detailed zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) condition of SCM TI buck is derived so that the converter does not experience redundant circulating energy. The experimental results of 15-W SCM TI buck converter prototypes are provided with 90.7% of peak power stage efficiency. The size of coupled inductor is down to 116 mm3. To enhance light-load efficiency, a variable frequency control scheme based on derived ZVS conditions is implemented with the switching frequency ranging from 2 MHz to 2.9 MHz.\",","31041":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"General-purpose step-down converter is essential in electronic system for processing energy from high-voltage rail to low-voltage circuits.

Thus, the amount of people exposed to wind farm noise is increasing. Due to its broadband amplitude modulated characteristic, wind turbine noise (WTN) is more annoying than noise produced by other common community/industrial sources. Aerodynamic noise along the blade span is the dominant noise source of modern large wind turbines. This type of noise propagates through the atmosphere in the proximity of wind farms. However, modelling and simulating WTN propagation over large distances is challenging due to the complexity of atmospheric conditions. Real temperature, wind velocity and relative humidity measurements typically show a characteristic nonlinear behavior. A comprehensive propagation model that addresses this problem while maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency is necessary. A Hamiltonian Ray tracing (HRT) technique coupled to aerodynamically induced WTN is presented in this work. It incorporates acoustic wave refraction due to spatial speed of sound gradients, a full Doppler Effect formulation resulting from wind velocities in any arbitrary direction, proper acoustic energy dissipation during propagation, and ground reflection. The HRT method averts many of the setbacks presented by other common numerical approaches such as fast field program (FFP), parabolic equation methods (PE), and the standard Eikonal ray tracing (ERT) technique. In addition, it is not bounded to the linearity assumptions made for analytic propagation solutions. A wave phase tracking analysis through inhomogeneous and moving media is performed. Curved ray-paths are numerically computed by solving a non-linear system of coupled first order differential equations. Sound pressure levels through the propagation media are then calculated by using standard ray tubes and performing energy analysis along them. The ray model is validated by comparing a monopole\u2019s ray path results against analytically obtained ones. Sound pressure level predictions are also validated against both FFP and ERT methods. Finally, results for a 5MW modern wind turbine over a flat acoustically soft terrain are provided.\",","31092":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"Modelling propagation of noise produced by wind turbines over large distances is a challenging task.

This method avoids many of the limitations and inaccurate assumptions presented by other common numerical and analytical approaches. In addition, current commercial noise propagation codes are incapable of fully capturing the physical complexity of the problem. Finally, validation and simulation results for a wind turbine over flat terrain are presented in order to demonstrate the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of the Hamiltonian approach.\",","31093":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","31094":"\"description-provenance\": [","31095":"\"AuthorAuthorAuthormsterl6@vt.edu\",","31096":"\"Provide open and immediate access to the ETD\",","31097":"\"I hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and submitted with my ETD a  \t\t\t\twritten permission statement from the ower(s) of each third part copyrighted matter to be included  \t\t\t\tin my thesis or dissertation, allowing distribution as specified above. \t\t\t\t I certify that the version I submitted is the same as that approved by my advisory committee.\",","31098":"\"Submitted by Sterling McBride (msterl6@vt.edu) on 2018-01-21T20:12:35Z No. of bitstreams2 license_rdf701 bytes, checksum42fd4ad1e89814f5e4a476b409eb708c (MD5) McBride_SM_T_2017.pdf9048809 bytes, checksum113ccdb4be68e649b5a1b17da19b8d5b (MD5)\",","31099":"\"Approved for entry into archive by Priscilla Wright (pkwright@vt.edu) on 2018-01-22T16:11:04Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams2 license_rdf701 bytes, checksum42fd4ad1e89814f5e4a476b409eb708c (MD5) McBride_SM_T_2017.pdf9048809 bytes, checksum113ccdb4be68e649b5a1b17da19b8d5b (MD5)\",","31100":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2018-01-23T13:59:07Z (GMT).

An applicant hiring simulation was implemented. 24 applicant profiles for the position of police officer were generated, six with high risk/ variable reward elements meant to align with individuals in a state of promotion fit, six with low-risk/consistent-reward elements meant to align with individuals in a state of prevention fit, and six applicant profiles with a high probability of succeeding and finally six applicant profiles meant to have a low probability of succeeding. Participants rated the applicant profiles on their suitability and recommended 12 applicants to be hired. Initial results did not support the hypotheses, however exploratory analysis did demonstrate fit sensitivity for prevention fit. Additional exploratory analyses are discussed and possible explanations for the lack of results are examined.\",","31139":"\"description-abstractgeneral\": \"Regulatory focus theory includes two types of motivational orientations, promotion focus which centers on seeking success and prevention focus which centers on avoiding failure. If the way an individual\u2019s pursues a goal (goal pursuit strategy) matches his or her regulatory focus orientation then he or she is considered to be in a state of regulatory fit. This state leads to various outcomes different than if an individual is in a state of non-fit. In the current study I have grouped these consequences into two typesfit sensitivity and performance. Essentially fit sensitivity is when the consequences seen do not have a correctness component and may be difference depending on the type of regulatory fit (promotion and prevention). Performance is when there is a correct or incorrect component to the outcome. The goal of the current study was to show that although fit sensitivity outcomes may be different for promotion fit and prevention fit, both fit states can lead to the same performance. With the initial analysis hypotheses were not supported but exploratory analysis did lend some support for prevention fit sensitivity. Discussion includes possible explanations for the lack of fit effects found.\",","31140":"\"description-degree\": \"MS\",","31141":"\"description-provenance\": [","31142":"\"Authorjag92@vt.edu\",","31143":"\"Provide open and immediate access to the ETD\",","31144":"\"I hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and submitted with my ETD a   \t\t\t\twritten permission statement from the ower(s) of each third part copyrighted matter to be included   \t\t\t\tin my thesis or dissertation, allowing distribution as specified above.  \t\t\t\t I certify that the version I submitted is the same as that approved by my advisory committee.\",","31145":"\"Submitted by Jessica Gladfelter (jag92@vt.edu) on 2017-12-13T14:37:28Z No. of bitstreams2 Gladfelter_JA_T_2017.pdf1775902 bytes, checksum6f261ac5279b41ecbefd7945a301882a (MD5) Gladfelter_JA_IRB_Approval_2017.pdf437596 bytes, checksum9bb56e6ac05aa74ad054b673895e44c7 (MD5)\",","31146":"\"Approved for entry into archive by Jenn Million (jennjw@vt.edu) on 2018-04-06T13:09:57Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams2 Gladfelter_JA_T_2017.pdf1775902 bytes, checksum6f261ac5279b41ecbefd7945a301882a (MD5) Gladfelter_JA_IRB_Approval_2017.pdf437596 bytes, checksum9bb56e6ac05aa74ad054b673895e44c7 (MD5)\",","31147":"\"Made available in DSpace on 2018-04-10T20:20:58Z (GMT).
